AB  - The term "artificial intelligence" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being 
      capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), 
      which "learns" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast 
      predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer 
      mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. 
      This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and 
      possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, 
      for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental 
      research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the 
      dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs 
      for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, 
      preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large 
      entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, 
      accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor 
      and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value 
      and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI 
      application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, 
      improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of 
      services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or 
      increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be 
      put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning 
      may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, 
      trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be 
      guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards 
      grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, 
      interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute 
      ("explainable AI"). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of 
      clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental 
      workforce.

AB  - Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more important in medicine and 
      in dentistry. It can be helpful in many fields where the human may be assisted 
      and helped by new technologies. Neural networks are a part of artificial 
      intelligence, and are similar to the human brain in their work and can solve 
      given problems and make fast decisions. This review shows that artificial 
      intelligence and the use of neural networks has developed very rapidly in recent 
      years, and it may be an ordinary tool in modern dentistry in the near future. The 
      advantages of this process are better efficiency, accuracy, and time saving 
      during the diagnosis and treatment planning. More research and improvements are 
      needed in the use of neural networks in dentistry to put them into daily practice 
      and to facilitate the work of the dentist.

AB  - One of the main goals of dental treatment is to mimic teeth and design smiles in 
      a most natural and aesthetic manner, based on the individual and specific needs 
      of the patient. Possibilities to reach that goal have significantly improved over 
      the last decade through new and specific treatment modalities, steadily enhanced 
      and more aesthetic dental materials, and novel techniques and technologies. This 
      article gives an overview of the evolution of aesthetic dentistry over the past 
      100 y from a historical point of view and highlights advances in the development 
      of dental research and clinical interventions that have contributed the science 
      and art of aesthetic dentistry. Among the most noteworthy advancements over the 
      past decade are the establishment of universal aesthetic rules and guidelines 
      based on the assessment of natural aesthetic parameters, anatomy, and 
      physiognomy; the development of tooth whitening and advanced restorative as well 
      as prosthetic materials and techniques, supported by the pioneering discovery of 
      dental adhesion; the significant progress in orthodontics and periodontal as well 
      as oral and maxillofacial surgery; and, most recently, the implementation of 
      digital technologies in the 3-dimensional planning and realization of truly 
      natural, individual, and aesthetic smiles. In the future, artificial intelligence 
      and machine learning will likely lead to automation of aesthetic evaluation, 
      smile design, and treatment-planning processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a comprehensive review of the use of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in dentistry, providing the community 
      with a broad insight on the different advances that these technologies and tools 
      have produced, paying special attention to the area of esthetic dentistry and 
      color research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The comprehensive review was conducted in 
      MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, for papers published in 
      English language in the last 20 years. RESULTS: Out of 3871 eligible papers, 120 
      were included for final appraisal. Study methodologies included deep learning 
      (DL; n = 76), fuzzy logic (FL; n = 12), and other ML techniques (n = 32), which 
      were mainly applied to disease identification, image segmentation, image 
      correction, and biomimetic color analysis and modeling. CONCLUSIONS: The insight 
      provided by the present work has reported outstanding results in the design of 
      high-performance decision support systems for the aforementioned areas. The 
      future of digital dentistry goes through the design of integrated approaches 
      providing personalized treatments to patients. In addition, esthetic dentistry 
      can benefit from those advances by developing models allowing a complete 
      characterization of tooth color, enhancing the accuracy of dental restorations. 
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of AI and ML has an increasing impact on the 
      dental profession and is complementing the development of digital technologies 
      and tools, with a wide application in treatment planning and esthetic dentistry 
      procedures.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies play a significant role and 
      significantly impact various sectors, including healthcare, engineering, 
      sciences, and smart cities. AI has the potential to improve the quality of 
      patient care and treatment outcomes while minimizing the risk of human error. 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the dental industry, just like it is 
      revolutionizing other sectors. It is used in dentistry to diagnose dental 
      diseases and provide treatment recommendations. Dental professionals are 
      increasingly relying on AI technology to assist in diagnosis, clinical 
      decision-making, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction across ten dental 
      specialties. One of the most significant advantages of AI in dentistry is its 
      ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing dental 
      professionals with valuable insights to enhance their decision-making processes. 
      The purpose of this paper is to identify the advancement of artificial 
      intelligence algorithms that have been frequently used in dentistry and assess 
      how well they perform in terms of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, treatment, 
      and prognosis prediction in ten dental specialties; dental public health, 
      endodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral medicine and pathology, oral & 
      maxillofacial radiology, orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics, pediatric 
      dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, and digital dentistry in general. We 
      will also show the pros and cons of using AI in all dental specialties in 
      different ways. Finally, we will present the limitations of using AI in 
      dentistry, which made it incapable of replacing dental personnel, and dentists, 
      who should consider AI a complimentary benefit and not a threat.

      it into intelligent actions. AI is a broad area that includes reasoning, typical 
      linguistic dispensation, machine learning, and planning. In the area of medicine 
      and dentistry, machine learning is currently the most widely used AI application. 
      This narrative review is aimed at giving an outline of cephalometric analysis in 
      orthodontics using AI. Latest algorithms are developing rapidly, and 
      computational resources are increasing, resulting in increased efficiency, 
      accuracy, and reliability. Current techniques for completely automatic 
      identification of cephalometric landmarks have considerably improved efficiency 
      and growth prospects for their regular use. The primary considerations for 
      effective orthodontic treatment are an accurate diagnosis, exceptional treatment 
      planning, and good prognosis estimation. The main objective of the AI technique 
      is to make dentists' work more precise and accurate. AI is increasingly being 
      used in the area of orthodontic treatment. It has been evidenced to be a 
      time-saving and reliable tool in many ways. AI is a promising tool for 
      facilitating cephalometric tracing in routine clinical practice and analyzing 
      large databases for research purposes.

TI  - Current Applications of Deep Learning and Radiomics on CT and CBCT for 
      Maxillofacial Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13010110 [doi]
LID - 110
AB  - The increasing use of computed tomography (CT) and cone beam computed tomography 
      (CBCT) in oral and maxillofacial imaging has driven the development of deep 
      learning and radiomics applications to assist clinicians in early diagnosis, 
      accurate prognosis prediction, and efficient treatment planning of maxillofacial 
      diseases. This narrative review aimed to provide an up-to-date overview of the 
      current applications of deep learning and radiomics on CT and CBCT for the 
      diagnosis and management of maxillofacial diseases. Based on current evidence, a 
      wide range of deep learning models on CT/CBCT images have been developed for 
      automatic diagnosis, segmentation, and classification of jaw cysts and tumors, 
      cervical lymph node metastasis, salivary gland diseases, temporomandibular (TMJ) 
      disorders, maxillary sinus pathologies, mandibular fractures, and 
      dentomaxillofacial deformities, while CT-/CBCT-derived radiomics applications 
      mainly focused on occult lymph node metastasis in patients with oral cancer, 
      malignant salivary gland tumors, and TMJ osteoarthritis. Most of these models 
      showed high performance, and some of them even outperformed human experts. The 
      models with performance on par with human experts have the potential to serve as 
      clinically practicable tools to achieve the earliest possible diagnosis and 
      treatment, leading to a more precise and personalized approach for the management 
      of maxillofacial diseases. Challenges and issues, including the lack of the 
      generalizability and explainability of deep learning models and the uncertainty 
      in the reproducibility and stability of radiomic features, should be overcome to 
      gain the trust of patients, providers, and healthcare organizers for daily 
      clinical use of these models.

TI  - Multiclass CBCT Image Segmentation for Orthodontics with Deep Learning.
PG  - 943-949
LID - 10.1177/00220345211005338 [doi]
AB  - Accurate segmentation of the jaw (i.e., mandible and maxilla) and the teeth in 
      cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is essential for orthodontic diagnosis 
      and treatment planning. Although various (semi)automated methods have been 
      proposed to segment the jaw or the teeth, there is still a lack of fully 
      automated segmentation methods that can simultaneously segment both anatomic 
      structures in CBCT scans (i.e., multiclass segmentation). In this study, we aimed 
      to train and validate a mixed-scale dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network for 
      multiclass segmentation of the jaw, the teeth, and the background in CBCT scans. 
      Thirty CBCT scans were obtained from patients who had undergone orthodontic 
      treatment. Gold standard segmentation labels were manually created by 4 dentists. 
      As a benchmark, we also evaluated MS-D networks that segmented the jaw or the 
      teeth (i.e., binary segmentation). All segmented CBCT scans were converted to 
      virtual 3-dimensional (3D) models. The segmentation performance of all trained 
      MS-D networks was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient and surface 
      deviation. The CBCT scans segmented by the MS-D network demonstrated a large 
      overlap with the gold standard segmentations (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.934 
      ± 0.019, jaw; 0.945 ± 0.021, teeth). The MS-D network-based 3D models of the jaw 
      and the teeth showed minor surface deviations when compared with the 
      corresponding gold standard 3D models (0.390 ± 0.093 mm, jaw; 0.204 ± 0.061 mm, 
      teeth). The MS-D network took approximately 25 s to segment 1 CBCT scan, whereas 
      manual segmentation took about 5 h. This study showed that multiclass 
      segmentation of jaw and teeth was accurate and its performance was comparable to 
      binary segmentation. The MS-D network trained for multiclass segmentation would 
      therefore make patient-specific orthodontic treatment more feasible by strongly 
      reducing the time required to segment multiple anatomic structures in CBCT scans.

      review.
PG  - 482-492
LID - 10.1016/j.jds.2020.05.022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In the recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has 
      revolutionized in the field of dentistry. The aim of this systematic review was 
      to document the scope and performance of the artificial intelligence based models 
      that have been widely used in orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and 
      predicting the prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature for this paper 
      was identified and selected by performing a thorough search for articles in the 
      electronic data bases like Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Google scholar, 
      Scopus and Web of science, Saudi digital library published over the past two 
      decades (January 2000-February 2020). After applying the inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria, 16 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. QUADAS-2 were 
      adapted for quality analysis of the studies included. RESULTS: AI technology has 
      been widely applied for identifying cephalometric landmarks, determining need for 
      orthodontic extractions, determining the degree of maturation of the cervical 
      vertebra, predicting the facial attractiveness after orthognathic surgery, 
      predicting the need for orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment 
      planning. Most of these artificial intelligence models are based on either 
      artificial neural networks (ANNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
      CONCLUSION: The results from these reported studies are suggesting that these 
      automated systems have performed exceptionally well, with an accuracy and 
      precision similar to the trained examiners. These systems can simplify the tasks 
      and provide results in quick time which can save the dentist time and help the 
      dentist to perform his duties more efficiently. These systems can be of great 
      value in orthodontics.

AB  - A reliable, individualized, and dynamic surrogate of cardiovascular risk, 
      synoptic for key biologic mechanisms, could shorten the path for drug 
      development, enhance drug cost-effectiveness and improve patient outcomes. We 
      used highly multiplexed proteomics to address these objectives, measuring about 
      5000 proteins in each of 32,130 archived plasma samples from 22,849 participants 
      in nine clinical studies. We used machine learning to derive a 27-protein model 
      predicting 4-year likelihood of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or 
      death. The 27 proteins encompassed 10 biologic systems, and 12 were associated 
      with relevant causal genetic traits. We independently validated results in 11,609 
      participants. Compared to a clinical model, the ratio of observed events in 
      quintile 5 to quintile 1 was 6.7 for proteins versus 2.9 for the clinical model, 
      AUCs (95% CI) were 0.73 (0.72 to 0.74) versus 0.64 (0.62 to 0.65), c-statistics 
      were 0.71 (0.69 to 0.72) versus 0.62 (0.60 to 0.63), and the net reclassification 
      index was +0.43. Adding the clinical model to the proteins only improved 
      discrimination metrics by 0.01 to 0.02. Event rates in four predefined protein 
      risk categories were 5.6, 11.2, 20.0, and 43.4% within 4 years; median time to 
      event was 1.71 years. Protein predictions were directionally concordant with 
      changed outcomes. Adverse risks were predicted for aging, approaching an event, 
      anthracycline chemotherapy, diabetes, smoking, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer 
      history, cardiovascular disease, high systolic blood pressure, and lipids. 
      Reduced risks were predicted for weight loss and exenatide. The 27-protein model 
      has potential as a "universal" surrogate end point for cardiovascular risk.

AB  - The integration of robotic technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in implant 
      dentistry has ushered in a new era of precision and efficiency. This 
      abstract aims to understand the integration, implications, potential, and 
      challenges of robotic technology and AI in implant dentistry. Robotic systems 
      offer unparalleled accuracy in implant placement, reducing human error and 
      improving treatment outcomes. AI algorithms analyze extensive patient data to 
      assist in diagnosis, treatment planning, and implant design, optimizing the 
      overall process. Successful case studies demonstrate improved implant survival 
      rates and patient satisfaction. However, ethical considerations and the balance 
      between human expertise and reliance on technology must be addressed. Ongoing 
      research aims to enhance these technologies and integrate them with digital 
      workflows. Collaboration and knowledge sharing among practitioners, researchers, 
      and industry experts are essential to drive progress and ensure responsible 
      implementation. The future of implant dentistry lies in harnessing the potential 
      of robotics and AI while upholding the highest standards of patient care and 
      ethical practice.

TI  - An immune dysfunction score for stratification of patients with acute infection 
      based on whole-blood gene expression.
PG  - eabq4433
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abq4433 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulated host responses to infection can lead to organ dysfunction and 
      sepsis, causing millions of global deaths each year. To alleviate this burden, 
      improved prognostication and biomarkers of response are urgently needed. We 
      investigated the use of whole-blood transcriptomics for stratification of 
      patients with severe infection by integrating data from 3149 samples from 
      patients with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia or fecal peritonitis 
      admitted to intensive care and healthy individuals into a gene expression 
      reference map. We used this map to derive a quantitative sepsis response 
      signature (SRSq) score reflective of immune dysfunction and predictive of 
      clinical outcomes, which can be estimated using a 7- or 12-gene signature. Last, 
      we built a machine learning framework, SepstratifieR, to deploy SRSq in adult and 
      pediatric bacterial and viral sepsis, H1N1 influenza, and COVID-19, demonstrating 
      clinically relevant stratification across diseases and revealing some of the 
      physiological alterations linking immune dysregulation to mortality. Our method 
      enables early identification of individuals with dysfunctional immune profiles, 
      bringing us closer to precision medicine in infection.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subdiscipline of computer science that has made 
      substantial progress in medicine and there is a growing body of AI research in 
      dentistry. Dentists should have an understanding of the foundational concepts and 
      the ability to critically evaluate dental research in AI. Machine learning (ML) 
      is a subfield of AI that most dental AI research is dedicated to. The most 
      prolific area of ML research is automated interpretation of dental imaging. Other 
      areas include providing treatment recommendations, predicting future disease and 
      treatment outcomes. The research impact is limited by small datasets that do not 
      harness the positive correlation between very large datasets and ML performance. 
      There is also a need to standardize research methodologies and utilize 
      performance metrics that are appropriate for the clinical context. In addition to 
      research challenges, this article discusses the ethical, legal and logistical 
      considerations associated with implementation in clinical practice. This includes 
      explainable AI, model bias, data privacy and security. The future implications of 
      AI in dentistry involve a promise for a novel form of practicing dentistry 
      however, the effect of AI on patient outcomes is yet to be determined.

AB  - The increasing storage of information, data, and forms of knowledge has led to 
      the development of new technologies that can help to accomplish complex tasks in 
      different areas, such as in dentistry. In this context, the role of computational 
      methods, such as radiomics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, has 
      been progressing remarkably for dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR). These tools 
      bring new perspectives for diagnosis, classification, and prediction of oral 
      diseases, treatment planning, and for the evaluation and prediction of outcomes, 
      minimizing the possibilities of human errors. A comprehensive review of the 
      state-of-the-art of using radiomics and machine learning (ML) for imaging in oral 
      healthcare is presented in this paper. Although the number of published studies 
      is still relatively low, the preliminary results are very promising and in a near 
      future, an augmented dentomaxillofacial radiology (ADMFR) will combine the use of 
      radiomics-based and AI-based analyses with the radiologist's evaluation. In 
      addition to the opportunities and possibilities, some challenges and limitations 
      have also been discussed for further investigations.

AB  - The developments in Artificial Intelligence have been on the rise since its 
      advent. The advancements in this field have been the innovative research area 
      across a wide range of industries, making its incorporation in dentistry 
      inevitable. Artificial Intelligence techniques are making serious progress in the 
      diagnostic and treatment planning aspects of dental clinical practice. This will 
      ultimately help in the elimination of subjectivity and human error that are often 
      part of radiographic interpretations, and will improve the overall efficiency of 
      the process. The various types of Artificial Intelligence algorithms that exist 
      today make the understanding of their application quite complex. The current 
      narrative review was planned to make comprehension of Artificial Intelligence 
      algorithms relatively straightforward. The focus was planned to be kept on the 
      current developments and prospects of Artificial Intelligence in dentistry, 
      especially Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks in diagnostic imaging. 
      The narrative review may facilitate the interpretation of seemingly perplexing 
      research published widely in dental journals.

TI  - AI in Orthodontics: Revolutionizing Diagnostics and Treatment Planning-A 
      Comprehensive Review.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13020344 [doi]
LID - 344
AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has transformed various 
      medical specialties, including orthodontics. AI has shown promising results in 
      enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses, treatment planning, and predicting treatment 
      outcomes. Its usage in orthodontic practices worldwide has increased with the 
      availability of various AI applications and tools. This review explores the 
      principles of AI, its applications in orthodontics, and its implementation in 
      clinical practice. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on 
      AI applications in dental diagnostics, cephalometric evaluation, skeletal age 
      determination, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) evaluation, decision making, and 
      patient telemonitoring. Due to study heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was 
      possible. AI has demonstrated high efficacy in all these areas, but variations in 
      performance and the need for manual supervision suggest caution in clinical 
      settings. The complexity and unpredictability of AI algorithms call for cautious 
      implementation and regular manual validation. Continuous AI learning, proper 
      governance, and addressing privacy and ethical concerns are crucial for 
      successful integration into orthodontic practice.

TI  - Rapid reduction in Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis subjects following 
      dupilumab treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by 
      dominant type 2 inflammation leading to chronic pruritic skin lesions, allergic 
      comorbidities, and Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization and infections. S 
      aureus is thought to play a role in AD severity. OBJECTIVES: This study 
      characterized the changes in the host-microbial interface in subjects with AD 
      following type 2 blockade with dupilumab. METHODS: Participants (n = 71) with 
      moderate-severe AD were enrolled in a randomized (dupilumab vs placebo; 2:1), 
      double-blind study at Atopic Dermatitis Research Network centers. Bioassays were 
      performed at multiple time points: S aureus and virulence factor quantification, 
      16s ribosomal RNA microbiome, serum biomarkers, skin transcriptomic analyses, and 
      peripheral blood T-cell phenotyping. RESULTS: At baseline, 100% of participants 
      were S aureus colonized on the skin surface. Dupilumab treatment resulted in 
      significant reductions in S aureus after only 3 days (compared to placebo), which 
      was 11 days before clinical improvement. Participants with the greatest S aureus 
      reductions had the best clinical outcomes, and these reductions correlated with 
      reductions in serum CCL17 and disease severity. Reductions (10-fold) in S aureus 
      cytotoxins (day 7), perturbations in T(H)17-cell subsets (day 14), and increased 
      expression of genes relevant for IL-17, neutrophil, and complement pathways (day 
      7) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Blockade of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, very 
      rapidly (day 3) reduces S aureus abundance in subjects with AD, and this 
      reduction correlates with reductions in the type 2 biomarker, CCL17, and measures 
      of AD severity (excluding itch). Immunoprofiling and/or transcriptomics suggest a 
      role for T(H)17 cells, neutrophils, and complement activation as potential 
      mechanisms to explain these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper provides an overview of existing applications and concepts 
      of robotic systems and artificial intelligence in dentistry. This review aims to 
      provide the community with novel inputs and argues for an increased utilization 
      of these recent technological developments, referred to as Dentronics, in order 
      to advance dentistry. METHODS: First, background on developments in robotics, 
      artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reviewed that may 
      enable novel assistive applications in dentistry (Sec A). Second, a systematic 
      technology review that evaluates existing state-of-the-art applications in AI, ML 
      and robotics in the context of dentistry is presented (Sec B). RESULTS: A 
      systematic literature research in pubmed yielded in a total of 558 results. 41 
      studies related to ML, 53 studies related to AI and 49 original research papers 
      on robotics application in dentistry were included. ML and AI have been applied 
      in dental research to analyze large amounts of data to eventually support dental 
      decision making, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning with the help of 
      data-driven analysis algorithms based on machine learning. So far, only few 
      robotic applications have made it to reality, mostly restricted to pilot use 
      cases. SIGNIFICANCE: The authors believe that dentistry can greatly benefit from 
      the current rise of digital human-centered automation and be transformed towards 
      a new robotic, ML and AI-enabled era. In the future, Dentronics will enhance 
      reliability, reproducibility, accuracy and efficiency in dentistry through the 
      democratized use of modern dental technologies, such as medical robot systems and 
      specialized artificial intelligence. Dentronics will increase our understanding 
      of disease pathogenesis, improve risk-assessment-strategies, diagnosis, disease 
      prediction and finally lead to better treatment outcomes.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Rotator Cuff Tears.
PG  - 67-72
LID - 10.1097/JSA.0000000000000371 [doi]
AB  - Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) negatively impacts patient well-being. Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) is emerging as a promising tool in medical decision-making. 
      Within AI, deep learning allows to autonomously solve complex tasks. This review 
      assesses the current and potential applications of AI in the management of RCT, 
      focusing on diagnostic utility, challenges, and future perspectives. AI 
      demonstrates promise in RCT diagnosis, aiding clinicians in interpreting complex 
      imaging data. Deep learning frameworks, particularly convoluted neural networks 
      architectures, exhibit remarkable diagnostic accuracy in detecting RCTs on 
      magnetic resonance imaging. Advanced segmentation algorithms improve anatomic 
      visualization and surgical planning. AI-assisted radiograph interpretation proves 
      effective in ruling out full-thickness tears. Machine learning models predict RCT 
      diagnosis and postoperative outcomes, enhancing personalized patient care. 
      Challenges include small data sets and classification complexities, especially 
      for partial thickness tears. Current applications of AI in RCT management are 
      promising yet experimental. The potential of AI to revolutionize personalized, 
      efficient, and accurate care for RCT patients is evident. The integration of AI 
      with clinical expertise holds potential to redefine treatment strategies and 
      optimize patient outcomes. Further research, larger data sets, and collaborative 
      efforts are essential to unlock the transformative impact of AI in orthopedic 
      surgery and RCT management.

      literature review.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.AKU-18 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to work like humans. The 
      concept initially began with the advent of mathematical models which gave 
      calculated outputs based on inputs fed into the system. This was later modified 
      with the introduction of various algorithms which can either give output based on 
      overall data analysis or by selection of information within previous data. It is 
      steadily becoming a favoured mode of treatment due to its efficiency and ability 
      to manage complex conditions in all specialities. In dentistry, artificial 
      intelligence has also popularised over the past few decades. They have been found 
      useful for diagnosis in restorative dentistry, oral pathology and oral surgery. 
      In orthodontics, they have been utilised for diagnosis, assessment of treatment 
      needs, cephalometrics, treatment planning and orthognathic surgeries etc. The 
      current literature review was planned to highlight the uses of artificial 
      intelligence in dentistry, specifically in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Its Application in Endodontics: A Review.
PG  - 912-917
LID - 10.5005/jp-journals-10024-3593 [doi]
AB  - AIM AND BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) since it was introduced into 
      dentistry, has become an important and valuable tool in many fields. It was 
      applied in different specialties with different uses, for example, in diagnosis 
      of oral cancer, periodontal disease and dental caries, and in the treatment 
      planning and predicting the outcome of orthognathic surgeries. The aim of this 
      comprehensive review is to report on the application and performance of AI models 
      designed for application in the field of endodontics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to collect the most 
      relevant articles using terms, such as AI, endodontics, and dentistry. This 
      review included 56 papers related to AI and its application in endodontics. 
      RESULT: The applications of AI were in detecting and diagnosing periapical 
      lesions, assessing root fractures, working length determination, prediction for 
      postoperative pain, studying root canal anatomy and decision-making in 
      endodontics for retreatment. The accuracy of AI in performing these tasks can 
      reach up to 90%. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence has valuable applications in 
      the field of modern endodontics with promising results. Larger and multicenter 
      data sets can give external validity to the AI models. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In 
      the field of dentistry, AI models are specifically crafted to contribute to the 
      diagnosis of oral diseases, ranging from common issues such as dental caries to 
      more complex conditions like periodontal diseases and oral cancer. AI models can 
      help in diagnosis, treatment planning, and in patient management in endodontics. 
      Along with the modern tools like cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), AI can be 
      a valuable aid to the clinician. How to cite this article: Ahmed ZH, Almuharib

TI  - The Future of Dentistry: How AI is Transforming Dental Practices.
PG  - 14-17
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) builds upon the digital tools the dental profession 
      has already adopted. It promises to transform the patient journey outlined above 
      and support the quest of the dental community to improve oral health. In this 
      review, we will detail how AI is used today in the clinic to improve patient care 
      and experience. The review will start with the diagnostic capabilities of AI and 
      then move to how it can be used to support treatment planning and patient 
      communication. It will end with a discussion of how AI quantification helps 
      dentists monitor longitudinal outcomes for patients and across the practice.

AB  - The accurate diagnosis of individual tooth prognosis has to be determined 
      comprehensively in consideration of the broader treatment plan. The objective of 
      this study was to establish an effective artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
      module for an accurate tooth prognosis decision based on the Harvard School of 
      Dental Medicine (HSDM) comprehensive treatment planning curriculum (CTPC). The 
      tooth prognosis of 2359 teeth from 94 cases was evaluated with 1 to 5 levels 
      (1-Hopeless, 5-Good condition for long term) by two groups (Model-A with 16, and 
      Model-B with 13 examiners) based on 17 clinical determining factors selected from 
      the HSDM-CTPC. Three AI machine-learning methods including gradient boosting 
      classifier, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier were used to 
      create an algorithm. These three methods were evaluated against the gold standard 
      data determined by consensus of three experienced prosthodontists, and their 
      accuracy was analyzed. The decision tree classifier indicated the highest 
      accuracy at 0.8413 (Model-A) and 0.7523 (Model-B). Accuracy with the gradient 
      boosting classifier and the random forest classifier was 0.6896, 0.6687, and 
      0.8413, 0.7523, respectively. Overall, the decision tree classifier had the best 
      accuracy among the three methods. The study contributes to the implementation of 
      AI in the decision-making process of tooth prognosis in consideration of the 
      treatment plan.

AB  - With increasing digitalization in orthodontics, certain orthodontic manufacturing 
      processes such as the fabrication of indirect bonding trays, aligner production, 
      or wire bending can be automated. However, orthodontic treatment planning and 
      evaluation remains a specialist's task and responsibility. As the prediction of 
      growth in orthodontic patients and response to orthodontic treatment is 
      inherently complex and individual, orthodontists make use of features gathered 
      from longitudinal, multimodal, and standardized orthodontic data sets. Currently, 
      these data sets are used by the orthodontist to make informed, rule-based 
      treatment decisions. In research, artificial intelligence (AI) has been 
      successfully applied to assist orthodontists with the extraction of relevant data 
      from such data sets. Here, AI has been applied for the analysis of clinical 
      imagery, such as automated landmark detection in lateral cephalograms but also 
      for evaluation of intraoral scans or photographic data. Furthermore, AI is 
      applied to help orthodontists with decision support for treatment decisions such 
      as the need for orthognathic surgery or for orthodontic tooth extractions. One 
      major challenge in current AI research in orthodontics is the limited 
      generalizability, as most studies use unicentric data with high risks of bias. 
      Moreover, comparing AI across different studies and tasks is virtually impossible 
      as both outcomes and outcome metrics vary widely, and underlying data sets are 
      not standardized. Notably, only few AI applications in orthodontics have reached 
      full clinical maturity and regulatory approval, and researchers in the field are 
      tasked with tackling real-world evaluation and implementation of AI into the 
      orthodontic workflow.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to 
      perform cognitive and intellectual human tasks. In dentistry, AI offers the 
      potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve patient outcomes and streamline 
      workflows. The present study provides a framework and a checklist to evaluate AI 
      applications in dentistry from this perspective. METHODS: Lending from existing 
      guidance documents, an initial draft of the checklist and an explanatory paper 
      were derived and discussed among the groups members. RESULTS: The checklist was 
      consented to in an anonymous voting process by 29 Topic Group Dental Diagnostics 
      and Digital Dentistry, ITU/WHO Focus Group AI on Health's members. Overall, 11 
      principles were identified (diversity, transparency, wellness, privacy 
      protection, solidarity, equity, prudence, law and governance, sustainable 
      development, accountability, and responsibility, respect of autonomy, 
      decision-making). CONCLUSIONS: Providers, patients, researchers, industry, and 
      other stakeholders should consider these principles when developing, 
      implementing, or receiving AI applications in dentistry. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
      While AI has become increasingly commonplace in dentistry, there are ethical 
      concerns around its usage, and users (providers, patients, and other 
      stakeholders), as well as the industry should consider these when developing, 
      implementing, or receiving AI applications based on comprehensive framework to 
      address the associated ethical challenges.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Its Clinical Applications in Orthodontics: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13243677 [doi]
LID - 3677
AB  - This review aims to analyze different strategies that make use of artificial 
      intelligence to enhance diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring in 
      orthodontics. Orthodontics has seen significant technological advancements with 
      the introduction of digital equipment, including cone beam computed tomography, 
      intraoral scanners, and software coupled to these devices. The use of deep 
      learning in software has sped up image processing processes. Deep learning is an 
      artificial intelligence technology that trains computers to analyze data like the 
      human brain does. Deep learning models are capable of recognizing complex 
      patterns in photos, text, audio, and other data to generate accurate information 
      and predictions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were 
      used to discover publications from 1 January 2013 to 18 October 2023 that matched 
      our topic. A comparison of various artificial intelligence applications in 
      orthodontics was generated. RESULTS: A final number of 33 studies were included 
      in the review for qualitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate 
      the effectiveness of AI in enhancing orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, 
      and assessment. A lot of articles emphasize the integration of artificial 
      intelligence into orthodontics and its potential to revolutionize treatment 
      monitoring, evaluation, and patient outcomes.

AB  - AIMS: The future dental and endodontic education must adapt to the current 
      digitalized healthcare system in a hyper-connected world. The purpose of this 
      scoping review was to investigate the ways an endodontic education curriculum 
      could benefit from the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      overcome the limitations of this technology in the delivery of healthcare to 
      patients. METHODS: An electronic search was carried out up to December 2023 using 
      MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and a manual search of reference 
      literature. Grey literature, ongoing clinical trials were also searched using 
      ClinicalTrials.gov. RESULTS: The search identified 251 records, of which 35 were 
      deemed relevant to artificial intelligence (AI) and Endodontic education. Areas 
      in which AI might aid students with their didactic and clinical endodontic 
      education were identified as follows: 1) radiographic interpretation; 2) 
      differential diagnosis; 3) treatment planning and decision-making; 4) case 
      difficulty assessment; 5) preclinical training; 6) advanced clinical simulation 
      and case-based training, 7) real-time clinical guidance; 8) autonomous systems 
      and robotics; 9) progress evaluation and personalized education; 10) calibration 
      and standardization. CONCLUSIONS: AI in endodontic education will support 
      clinical and didactic teaching through individualized feedback; enhanced, 
      augmented, and virtually generated training aids; automated detection and 
      diagnosis; treatment planning and decision support; and AI-based student progress 
      evaluation, and personalized education. Its implementation will inarguably change 
      the current concept of teaching Endodontics. Dental educators would benefit from 
      introducing AI in clinical and didactic pedagogy; however, they must be aware of 
      AI's limitations and challenges to overcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop artificial intelligence (AI) 
      guided framework to recognize tooth numbers in panoramic and intraoral 
      radiographs (periapical and bitewing) without prior domain knowledge and arrange 
      the intraoral radiographs into a full mouth series (FMS) arrangement template. 
      This model can be integrated with different diseases diagnosis models, such as 
      periodontitis or caries, to facilitate clinical examinations and diagnoses. 
      METHODS: The framework utilized image segmentation models to generate the masks 
      of bone area, tooth, and cementoenamel junction (CEJ) lines from intraoral 
      radiographs. These masks were used to detect and extract teeth bounding boxes 
      utilizing several image analysis methods. Then, individual teeth were matched 
      with a patient's panoramic images (if available) or tooth repositories for 
      assigning tooth numbers using the multi-scale matching strategy. This framework 
      was tested on 1240 intraoral radiographs different from the training and internal 
      validation cohort to avoid data snooping. Besides, a web interface was designed 
      to generate a report for different dental abnormalities with tooth numbers to 
      evaluate this framework's practicality in clinical settings. RESULTS: The 
      proposed method achieved the following precision and recall via panoramic view: 
      0.96 and 0.96 (via panoramic view) and 0.87 and 0.87 (via repository match) by 
      handling tooth shape variation and outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. 
      Additionally, the proposed framework could accurately arrange a set of intraoral 
      radiographs into an FMS arrangement template based on positions and tooth numbers 
      with an accuracy of 95% for periapical images and 90% for bitewing images. The 
      accuracy of this framework was also 94% in the images with missing teeth and 89% 
      with restorations. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed tooth numbering model is robust and 
      self-contained and can also be integrated with other dental diagnosis modules, 
      such as alveolar bone assessment and caries detection. This artificial 
      intelligence-based tooth detection and tooth number assignment in dental 
      radiographs will help dentists with enhanced communication, documentation, and 
      treatment planning accurately. In addition, the proposed framework can correctly 
      specify detailed diagnostic information associated with a single tooth without 
      human intervention.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in 
      various ways in medicine and dentistry. Advancements in AI technology show 
      promising results in the practice of orthodontics. This scoping review aimed to 
      investigate the effectiveness of AI-based models employed in orthodontic landmark 
      detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. METHODS: A precise search of 
      electronic databases was conducted, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and 
      Embase (English publications from January 2010 to July 2020). Quality Assessment 
      and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool 2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the quality of the 
      articles included in this review. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria, 49 articles were included in the final review. AI technology has 
      achieved state-of-the-art results in various orthodontic applications, including 
      automated landmark detection on lateral cephalograms and photography images, 
      cervical vertebra maturation degree determination, skeletal classification, 
      orthodontic tooth extraction decisions, predicting the need for orthodontic 
      treatment or orthognathic surgery, and facial attractiveness. Most of the AI 
      models used in these applications are based on artificial neural networks. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AI can help orthodontists save time and provide accuracy comparable 
      to the trained dentists in diagnostic assessments and prognostic predictions. 
      These systems aim to boost performance and enhance the quality of care in 
      orthodontics. However, based on current studies, the most promising application 
      was cephalometry landmark detection, skeletal classification, and decision making 
      on tooth extractions.

LID - 18
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the existing 
      evidence on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in 
      orthodontics, its translation into clinical practice, and what limitations do 
      exist that have precluded their envisioned application. METHODS: A scoping review 
      of the literature was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PubMed was 
      searched until July 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-two articles fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria. A total of 43 out of the 62 studies (69.35%) were published this last 
      decade. The majority of these studies were from the USA (11), followed by South 
      Korea (9) and China (7). The number of studies published in non-orthodontic 
      journals (36) was more extensive than in orthodontic journals (26). Artificial 
      Neural Networks (ANNs) were found to be the most commonly utilized AI/ML 
      algorithm (13 studies), followed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support 
      Vector Machine (SVM) (9 studies each), and regression (8 studies). The most 
      commonly studied domains were diagnosis and treatment planning-either broad-based 
      or specific (33), automated anatomic landmark detection and/or analyses (19), 
      assessment of growth and development (4), and evaluation of treatment outcomes 
      (2). The different characteristics and distribution of these studies have been 
      displayed and elucidated upon therein. CONCLUSION: This scoping review suggests 
      that there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies involving 
      various orthodontic applications of AI and ML. The most commonly studied domains 
      were diagnosis and treatment planning, automated anatomic landmark detection 
      and/or analyses, and growth and development assessment.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology in 
      various industries, and its potential in dentistry is gaining significant 
      attention. This abstract explores the future prospects of AI in dentistry, 
      highlighting its potential to revolutionize clinical practice, improve patient 
      outcomes, and enhance the overall efficiency of dental care. The application of 
      AI in dentistry encompasses several key areas, including diagnosis, treatment 
      planning, image analysis, patient management, and personalized care. AI 
      algorithms have shown promising results in the automated detection and diagnosis 
      of dental conditions, such as caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancers, 
      aiding clinicians in early intervention and improving treatment outcomes. 
      Furthermore, AI-powered treatment planning systems leverage machine learning 
      techniques to analyze vast amounts of patient data, considering factors like 
      medical history, anatomical variations, and treatment success rates. These 
      systems provide dentists with valuable insights and support in making 
      evidence-based treatment decisions, ultimately leading to more predictable and 
      tailored treatment approaches. While the potential of AI in dentistry is immense, 
      it is essential to address certain challenges, including data privacy, algorithm 
      bias, and regulatory considerations. Collaborative efforts between dental

AB  - Personalized medicine refers to the tailoring of diagnostics and therapeutics to 
      individuals based on one's biological, social, and behavioral characteristics. 
      While personalized dental medicine is still far from being a reality, advanced 
      artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with improved data analytic approaches 
      are expected to integrate diverse data from the individual, setting, and system 
      levels, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the interaction of these 
      multilevel data and therefore bring us closer to more personalized, predictive, 
      preventive, and participatory dentistry, also known as P4 dentistry. In the field 
      of dentomaxillofacial imaging, a wide range of AI applications, including several 
      commercially available software options, have been proposed to assist dentists in 
      the diagnosis and treatment planning of various dentomaxillofacial diseases, with 
      performance similar or even superior to that of specialists. Notably, the impact 
      of these dental AI applications on treatment decision, clinical and 
      patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness has so far been assessed 
      sparsely. Such information should be further investigated in future studies to 
      provide patients, providers, and healthcare organizers a clearer picture of the 
      true usefulness of AI in daily dental practice.

LID - 2760
AB  - In recent years, there has been the notable emergency of artificial intelligence 
      (AI) as a transformative force in multiple domains, including orthodontics. This 
      review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the present state of AI 
      applications in orthodontics, which can be categorized into the following 
      domains: (1) diagnosis, including cephalometric analysis, dental analysis, facial 
      analysis, skeletal-maturation-stage determination and upper-airway obstruction 
      assessment; (2) treatment planning, including decision making for extractions and 
      orthognathic surgery, and treatment outcome prediction; and (3) clinical 
      practice, including practice guidance, remote care, and clinical documentation. 
      We have witnessed a broadening of the application of AI in orthodontics, 
      accompanied by advancements in its performance. Additionally, this review 
      outlines the existing limitations within the field and offers future 
      perspectives.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer science that has garnered 
      significant interest in the field of medicine because of its problem solving, 
      decision making and pattern recognition abilities. Machine learning, a subset of 
      artificial intelligence, hones in on the ability of computers to receive data and 
      learn for themselves, manipulating algorithms as they organize the information 
      they are processing. Dermatology is at a particular advantage in the 
      implementation of machine learning due to the availability of large clinical 
      image databases that can be used for machine training and interpretation. While 
      numerous studies have implemented machine learning in the diagnostic aspect of 
      dermatology, less research has been conducted on the use of machine learning in 
      predicting long-term outcomes in skin disease, with only a few studies published 
      to date. Such an approach would assist physicians in selecting the best treatment 
      methods, save patients' time, reduce treatment costs and improve the quality of 
      treatment overall by reducing the amount of trial-and-error in the treatment 
      process. In this review, we aim to provide a brief and relevant introduction to 
      basic artificial intelligence processes, and to consolidate and examine the 
      published literature on the use of machine learning in predicting clinical 
      outcomes in dermatology.

TI  - Deep Learning in Diagnosis of Dental Anomalies and Diseases: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13152512 [doi]
LID - 2512
AB  - Deep learning and diagnostic applications in oral and dental health have received 
      significant attention recently. In this review, studies applying deep learning to 
      diagnose anomalies and diseases in dental image material were systematically 
      compiled, and their datasets, methodologies, test processes, explainable 
      artificial intelligence methods, and findings were analyzed. Tests and results in 
      studies involving human-artificial intelligence comparisons are discussed in 
      detail to draw attention to the clinical importance of deep learning. In 
      addition, the review critically evaluates the literature to guide and further 
      develop future studies in this field. An extensive literature search was 
      conducted for the 2019-May 2023 range using the Medline (PubMed) and Google 
      Scholar databases to identify eligible articles, and 101 studies were 
      shortlisted, including applications for diagnosing dental anomalies (n = 22) and 
      diseases (n = 79) using deep learning for classification, object detection, and 
      segmentation tasks. According to the results, the most commonly used task type 
      was classification (n = 51), the most commonly used dental image material was 
      panoramic radiographs (n = 55), and the most frequently used performance metric 
      was sensitivity/recall/true positive rate (n = 87) and accuracy (n = 69). Dataset 
      sizes ranged from 60 to 12,179 images. Although deep learning algorithms are used 
      as individual or at least individualized architectures, standardized 
      architectures such as pre-trained CNNs, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and U-Net have been 
      used in most studies. Few studies have used the explainable AI method (n = 22) 
      and applied tests comparing human and artificial intelligence (n = 21). Deep 
      learning is promising for better diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry 
      based on the high-performance results reported by the studies. For all that, 
      their safety should be demonstrated using a more reproducible and comparable 
      methodology, including tests with information about their clinical applicability, 
      by defining a standard set of tests and performance metrics.

TI  - Competencies for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Primary Care.
PG  - 559-563
LID - 10.1370/afm.2887 [doi]
AB  - The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has arrived for the health care 
      sector and is finally penetrating the far-reaching but perpetually underfinanced 
      primary care platform. While AI has the potential to facilitate the achievement 
      of the Quintuple Aim (better patient outcomes, population health, and health 
      equity at lower costs while preserving clinician well-being), inattention to 
      primary care training in the use of AI-based tools risks the opposite effects, 
      imposing harm and exacerbating inequalities. The impact of AI-based tools on 
      these aims will depend heavily on the decisions and skills of primary care 
      clinicians; therefore, appropriate medical education and training will be crucial 
      to maximize potential benefits and minimize harms. To facilitate this training, 
      we propose 6 domains of competency for the effective deployment of AI-based tools 
      in primary care: (1) foundational knowledge (what is this tool?), (2) critical 
      appraisal (should I use this tool?), (3) medical decision making (when should I 
      use this tool?), (4) technical use (how do I use this tool?), (5) patient 
      communication (how should I communicate with patients regarding the use of this 
      tool?), and (6) awareness of unintended consequences (what are the "side effects" 
      of this tool?). Integrating these competencies will not be straightforward 
      because of the breadth of knowledge already incorporated into family medicine 
      training and the constantly changing technological landscape. Nonetheless, even 
      incremental increases in AI-relevant training may be beneficial, and the sooner 
      these challenges are tackled, the sooner the primary care workforce and those 
      served by it will begin to reap the benefits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in orthodontics and 
      orthognathic surgery has gained significant attention in recent years. However, 
      there is a lack of bibliometric reports that analyze the academic literature in 
      this field to identify publishing and citation trends. By conducting an analysis 
      of the top 100 most-cited articles on AI in orthodontics and orthognathic 
      surgery, we aim to unveil popular research topics, key authors, institutions, 
      countries, and journals in this area. METHODS: A comprehensive search was 
      conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) electronic database to identify the top 100 
      most-cited articles on AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Publication 
      and citation data were obtained and further analyzed and visualized using R 
      Biblioshiny. The key domains of the 100 articles were also identified. RESULTS: 
      The top 100 most-cited articles were published between 2005 and 2022, contributed 
      by 458 authors, with an average citation count of 22.09. South Korea emerged as 
      the leading contributor with the highest number of publications (28) and 
      citations (595), followed by China (16, 373), and the United States (7, 248). 
      Notably, six South Korean authors ranked among the top 10 contributors, and three 
      South Korean institutions were listed as the most productive. International 
      collaborations were predominantly observed between the United States, China, and 
      South Korea. The main domains of the articles focused on automated imaging 
      assessment (42%), aiding diagnosis and treatment planning (34%), and the 
      assessment of growth and development (10%). Besides, a positive correlation was 
      observed between the testing sample size and citation counts (P = 0.010), as well 
      as between the time of publication and citation counts (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The utilization of AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery has shown 
      remarkable progress, particularly in the domains of imaging analysis, diagnosis 
      and treatment planning, and growth and development assessment. This bibliometric 
      analysis provides valuable insights into the top-cited articles and the trends of 
      AI research in this field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Successful application of deep machine learning could reduce 
      time-consuming and labor-intensive clinical work of calculating the amount of 
      radiographic bone loss (RBL) in diagnosing and treatment planning for 
      periodontitis. This study aimed to test the accuracy of RBL classification by 
      machine learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with 
      standardized full mouth radiographs were included. Each tooth from the periapical 
      films was evaluated by three calibrated periodontists for categorization of RBL 
      and radiographic defect morphology. Each image was pre-processed and augmented to 
      ensure proper data balancing without data pollution, then a novel multitasking 
      InceptionV3 model was applied. RESULTS: The model demonstrated an average 
      accuracy of 0.87 ± 0.01 in the categorization of mild (< 15%) or severe (≥ 15%) 
      bone loss with fivefold cross-validation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      predictive, and negative predictive values of the model were 0.86 ± 0.03, 
      0.88 ± 0.03, 0.88 ± 0.03, and 0.86 ± 0.02, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Application 
      of deep machine learning for the detection of alveolar bone loss yielded 
      promising results in this study. Additional data would be beneficial to enhance 
      model construction and enable better machine learning performance for clinical 
      implementation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Higher accuracy of radiographic bone loss 
      classification by machine learning can be achieved with more clinical data and 
      proper model construction for valuable clinical application.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of 
      a new deep-learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for diagnostic 
      charting in panoramic radiography. METHODS: One thousand eighty-four anonymous 
      dental panoramic radiographs were labeled by two dento-maxillofacial radiologists 
      for ten different dental situations: crown, pontic, root-canal treated tooth, 
      implant, implant-supported crown, impacted tooth, residual root, filling, caries, 
      and dental calculus. AI Model CranioCatch, developed in Eskişehir, Turkey and 
      based on a deep CNN method, was proposed to be evaluated. A Faster R-CNN 
      Inception v2 (COCO) model implemented with the TensorFlow library was used for 
      model development. The assessment of AI model performance was evaluated with 
      sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. RESULTS: When the performance of the 
      proposed AI model for detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs was 
      evaluated, the best sensitivity values were obtained from the crown, implant, and 
      impacted tooth as 0.9674, 0.9615, and 0.9658, respectively. The worst sensitivity 
      values were obtained from the pontic, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.7738, 
      0.3026, and 0.0934, respectively. The best precision values were obtained from 
      pontic, implant, implant-supported crown as 0.8783, 0.9259, and 0.8947, 
      respectively. The worst precision values were obtained from residual root, 
      caries, and dental calculus, as 0.6764, 0.5096, and 0.1923, respectively. The 
      most successful F1 Scores were obtained from the implant, crown, and 
      implant-supported crown, as 0.9433, 0.9122, and 0.8947, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      The proposed AI model has promising results at detecting dental conditions in 
      panoramic radiographs, except for caries and dental calculus. Thanks to the 
      improvement of AI models in all areas of dental radiology, we predict that they 
      will help physicians in panoramic diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as 
      digital-based student education, especially during the pandemic period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning 
      are playing an increasingly significant role in the medical field in the 21st 
      century. These recent technologies are based on the concept of creating machines 
      that have the potential to function as a human brain. It necessitates the 
      gathering of large quantity of data to be processed. Once processed with AI 
      machines, these data have the potential to streamline and improve the 
      capabilities of the medical field in diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as 
      in the prediction and recognition of diseases. These concepts are new to 
      Orthodontics and are currently limited to image processing and pattern 
      recognition. OBJECTIVE: This article exposes and describes the different methods 
      by which orthodontics may benefit from a more widespread adoption of these 
      technologies.

TI  - A Novel Machine Learning Model for Predicting Orthodontic Treatment Duration.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13172740 [doi]
LID - 2740
AB  - In the field of orthodontics, providing patients with accurate treatment time 
      estimates is of utmost importance. As orthodontic practices continue to evolve 
      and embrace new advancements, incorporating machine learning (ML) methods becomes 
      increasingly valuable in improving orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. 
      This study aimed to develop a novel ML model capable of predicting the 
      orthodontic treatment duration based on essential pre-treatment variables. 
      Patients who completed comprehensive orthodontic treatment at the Indiana 
      University School of Dentistry were included in this retrospective study. 
      Fifty-seven pre-treatment variables were collected and used to train and test 
      nine different ML models. The performance of each model was assessed using 
      descriptive statistics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and one-way analysis 
      of variance tests. Random Forest, Lasso, and Elastic Net were found to be the 
      most accurate, with a mean absolute error of 7.27 months in predicting treatment 
      duration. Extraction decision, COVID, intermaxillary relationship, lower incisor 
      position, and additional appliances were identified as important predictors of 
      treatment duration. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of ML in 
      predicting orthodontic treatment duration using pre-treatment variables.

AB  - In this study, multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks are used to 
      predict orthodontic treatment plans, including the determination of 
      extraction-nonextraction, extraction patterns, and anchorage patterns. The neural 
      network can output the feasibilities of several applicable treatment plans, 
      offering orthodontists flexibility in making decisions. The neural network models 
      show an accuracy of 94.0% for extraction-nonextraction prediction, with an area 
      under the curve (AUC) of 0.982, a sensitivity of 94.6%, and a specificity of 
      93.8%. The accuracies of the extraction patterns and anchorage patterns are 84.2% 
      and 92.8%, respectively. The most important features for prediction of the neural 
      networks are "crowding, upper arch" "ANB" and "curve of Spee". For handling 
      discrete input features with missing data, the average value method has a better 
      complement performance than the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method; for handling 
      continuous features with missing data, k-NN performs better than the other 
      methods most of the time. These results indicate that the proposed method based 
      on artificial neural networks can provide good guidance for orthodontic treatment 
      planning for less-experienced orthodontists.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in medico-dental diagnostics of the face: a narrative 
      review of opportunities and challenges.
PG  - 6871-6879
LID - 10.1007/s00784-022-04724-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This review aims to share the current developments of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) solutions in the field of medico-dental diagnostics of the 
      face. The primary focus of this review is to present the applicability of 
      artificial neural networks (ANN) to interpret medical images, together with the 
      associated opportunities, obstacles, and ethico-legal concerns. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Narrative literature review. RESULTS: Narrative literature review. 
      CONCLUSION: Curated facial images are widely available and easily accessible and 
      are as such particularly suitable big data for ANN training. New AI solutions 
      have the potential to change contemporary dentistry by optimizing existing 
      processes and enriching dental care with the introduction of new tools for 
      assessment or treatment planning. The analyses of health-related big data may 
      also contribute to revolutionize personalized medicine through the detection of 
      previously unknown associations. In regard to facial images, advances in 
      medico-dental AI-based diagnostics include software solutions for the detection 
      and classification of pathologies, for rating attractiveness and for the 
      prediction of age or gender. In order for an ANN to be suitable for medical 
      diagnostics of the face, the arising challenges regarding computation and 
      management of the software are discussed, with special emphasis on the use of 
      non-medical big data for ANN training. The legal and ethical ramifications of 
      feeding patients' facial images to a neural network for diagnostic purposes are 
      related to patient consent, data privacy, data security, liability, and 
      intellectual property. Current ethico-legal regulation practices seem incapable 
      of addressing all concerns and ensuring accountability. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
      While this review confirms the many benefits derived from AI solutions used for 
      the diagnosis of medical images, it highlights the evident lack of regulatory 
      oversight, the urgent need to establish licensing protocols, and the imperative 
      to investigate the moral quality of new norms set with the implementation of AI 
      applications in medico-dental diagnostics.

AB  - Over the recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been progressing rapidly 
      with its ability to mimic human cognitive functions. The potential applications 
      of AI technology in diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction have 
      been demonstrated in various studies. The present scoping review aimed to provide 
      an overview of AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and their applications in 
      orthognathic surgery. A comprehensive search was conducted in databases including 
      PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and OVID Medline until November 2021. This 
      scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. After applying 
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 19 studies were included for 
      final review. AI has profoundly impacted the diagnosis and prediction of 
      orthognathic surgeries with a clinically acceptable accuracy range. Furthermore, 
      AI reduces the work burden of the clinician by eliminating the tedious 
      registration procedures, thereby helping in efficient and automated planning. 
      However, focussing on the research gaps, there is a need to foster the AI 
      models/algorithms to contemporize their efficiency in clinical decision making, 
      diagnosis and surgical planning in future studies.

TI  - Exploring the Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Clinical Healthcare: A 
      Multidisciplinary Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13121995 [doi]
LID - 1995
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a more and more important role in our everyday 
      life due to the advantages that it brings when used, such as 24/7 availability, a 
      very low percentage of errors, ability to provide real time insights, or 
      performing a fast analysis. AI is increasingly being used in clinical medical and 
      dental healthcare analyses, with valuable applications, which include disease 
      diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment planning, and drug discovery. This paper 
      presents a narrative literature review of AI use in healthcare from a 
      multi-disciplinary perspective, specifically in the cardiology, allergology, 
      endocrinology, and dental fields. The paper highlights data from recent research 
      and development efforts in AI for healthcare, as well as challenges and 
      limitations associated with AI implementation, such as data privacy and security 
      considerations, along with ethical and legal concerns. The regulation of 
      responsible design, development, and use of AI in healthcare is still in early 
      stages due to the rapid evolution of the field. However, it is our duty to 
      carefully consider the ethical implications of implementing AI and to respond 
      appropriately. With the potential to reshape healthcare delivery and enhance 
      patient outcomes, AI systems continue to reveal their capabilities.

TI  - Orthodontics in the era of big data analytics.
PG  - 8-13
LID - 10.1111/ocr.12279 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this report was to provide an overview of the current landscape 
      of big data analytics in the healthcare sector, introduce various approaches of 
      machine learning and discuss potential implications in the field of orthodontics. 
      With the increasing availability of data from various sources, the traditional 
      analytical methods may not be conducive anymore for examining clinical outcomes. 
      Machine-learning approaches, which are algorithms trained to identify patterns in 
      large data sets, are ideally suited to facilitate data-driven decision making. 
      The field of orthodontics is particularly ripe for embracing the big data 
      analytics platform to improve decision making in clinical practice. The 
      availability of omics data, state-of-the-art imaging and potential for 
      establishing large clinical data repositories have favourably positioned the 
      specialty of orthodontics to deliver personalized and precision orthodontic care. 
      Specifically, we discuss about next-generation sequencing, radiomics in the 
      context of CBCT imaging, and how centralized data repositories can enable 
      real-time data pooling from multiple sources.

AB  - Chronic Painful Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) are challenging to diagnose and 
      manage due to their complexity and lack of understanding of brain mechanism. In 
      the past few decades' neural mechanisms of pain regulation and perception have 
      been clarified by neuroimaging research. Advances in the neuroimaging have 
      bridged the gap between brain activity and the subjective experience of pain. 
      Neuroimaging has also made strides toward separating the neural mechanisms 
      underlying the chronic painful TMD. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is 
      transforming various sectors by automating tasks that previously required humans' 
      intelligence to complete. AI has started to contribute to the recognition, 
      assessment, and understanding of painful TMD. The application of AI and 
      neuroimaging in understanding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of chronic 
      painful TMD are still in its early stages. The objective of the present review is 
      to identify the contemporary neuroimaging approaches such as structural, 
      functional, and molecular techniques that have been used to investigate the brain 
      of chronic painful TMD individuals. Furthermore, this review guides practitioners 
      on relevant aspects of AI and how AI and neuroimaging methods can revolutionize 
      our understanding on the mechanisms of painful TMD and aid in both diagnosis and 
      management to enhance patient outcomes.

AB  - AIM: To know attitudes, perceptions and barriers towards the use of Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) in dentistry in India among undergraduate and postgraduate 
      students. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted 
      among participants pursuing graduation and postgraduation. The questionnaire 
      consisted of 23 close-ended and 2 open-ended questions divided into various 
      sections of attitude, perception and barriers. The data was analysed using 
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. RESULT: Out of 937 
      responses, 55.2% responded that they get information about AI from social media 
      platforms. 51.3% of respondents have basic knowledge about the use of AI in 
      dentistry. 59.6% agreed that AI can be used as a "definitive diagnostic tool" in 
      the diagnosis of diseases. 66.5% agreed that AI can be used for radiographic 
      diagnosis of tooth caries. 71.3% stated that AI can be used as a "treatment 
      planning tool" in dentistry. 55.7% stated that AI should be part of undergraduate 
      dental training. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that both dental students are 
      aware of the concept of AI. Participants were positive when asked if AI can 
      increase the efficiency of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning procedures 
      as well as in managing patient data. Both participants believed that the barriers 
      to the introduction of AI in dentistry are a lack of technical resources and a 
      lack of training personnel in college.

TI  - Applications and performance of artificial intelligence models in removable 
      prosthodontics: A literature review.
LID - 10.2186/jpr.JPR_D_23_00073 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this narrative review, we present the current applications and 
      performances of artificial intelligence (AI) models in different phases of the 
      removable prosthodontic workflow and related research topics. STUDY SELECTION: A 
      literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google 
      Scholar databases between January 2010 and January 2023. Search terms related to 
      AI were combined with terms related to removable prosthodontics. Articles 
      reporting the structure and performance of the developed AI model were selected 
      for this literature review. RESULTS: A total of 15 articles were relevant to the 
      application of AI in removable prosthodontics, including maxillofacial 
      prosthetics. These applications included the design of removable partial 
      dentures, classification of partially edentulous arches, functional evaluation 
      and outcome prediction in complete denture treatment, early prosthetic management 
      of patients with cleft lip and palate, coloration of maxillofacial prostheses, 
      and prediction of the material properties of denture teeth. Various AI models 
      with reliable prediction accuracy have been developed using supervised learning. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current applications of AI in removable prosthodontics exhibit 
      significant potential for improving the prosthodontic workflow, with high 
      accuracy levels reported in most of the reviewed studies. However, the focus has 
      been predominantly on the diagnostic phase, with few studies addressing treatment 
      planning and implementation. Because the number of AI-related studies in 
      removable prosthodontics is limited, more models targeting different 
      prosthodontic disciplines are required.

TI  - The role of neural artificial intelligence for diagnosis and treatment planning 
      in endodontics: A qualitative review.
PG  - 270-281
LID - 10.1016/j.sdentj.2022.04.004 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently increasing in 
      terms of diagnosing diseases and planning treatment in endodontics. However, 
      findings from individual research studies are not systematically reviewed and 
      compiled together. Hence, this study aimed to systematically review, appraise, 
      and evaluate neural AI algorithms employed and their comparative efficacy to 
      conventional methods in endodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. METHODS: The 
      present research question focused on the literature search about different AI 
      algorithms and models of AI assisted endodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. 
      The search engine included databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science 
      Direct with search criteria of primary research paper, published in English, and 
      analyzed data on AI and its role in the field of endodontics. RESULTS: The 
      initial search resulted in 785 articles, exclusion based on abstract relevance, 
      animal studies, grey literature and letter to editors narrowed down the scope of 
      selected articles to 11 accepted for review. The review data supported the 
      findings that AI can play a crucial role in the area of endodontics, such as 
      identification of apical lesions, classifying and numbering teeth, detecting 
      dental caries, periodontitis and periapical disease, diagnosing different dental 
      problems, helping dentists make referrals, and also helping them make plans for 
      treatment of dental disorders in a timely and effective manner with greater 
      accuracy. CONCLUSION: AI with different models or frameworks and algorithms can 
      help dentists to diagnose and manage endodontic problems with greater accuracy. 
      However, endodontic fraternity needs to provide more emphasis on the utilization 
      of AI, provision of evidence based guidelines and implementation of the AI 
      models.

TI  - Clinical use of digital applications for diagnostic and treatment planning in 
      prosthodontics: A scoping review.
LID - 10.1111/clr.14230 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This scoping review aimed to compile and evaluate clinical trials 
      investigating digital applications in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment 
      planning by assessing their clinical relevance and future potential. METHODS: 
      Following the PCC-framework for scoping reviews and combining the source of 
      analysis (Population/P: "prosthodontics"), the technique of interest (Concept/C: 
      "digital application") and the field of interest (Context/C: "diagnostics"), a 
      three-pronged search strategy was applied in the database PubMed and Web of 
      Science. Clinical trials (≥10 study participants, English/German) were considered 
      until 2023-03-09. Reporting adhered to the PRISMA-ScR statement. RESULTS: The 
      search identified 520 titles, of which 18 full-texts met the inclusion criteria 
      for data extraction. The trials involved a total of 14,457 study participants and 
      were mapped for prosthetic subdisciplines: fixed (n = 9; 50%) and removable 
      (n = 4; 22%) prosthodontics, reconstructive dentistry in general (n = 3; 17%), 
      and temporo-mandibular joint disorders (n = 2; 11%). Data merging of medical 
      format files, as DICOM+STL, was the dominant digital application (n = 7; 39%); 
      and virtual treatment simulation using digital smile design or digital wax-up 
      represented the most frequent prosthetic diagnostics (n = 6; 33%). CONCLUSION: 
      This scoping review identified a relatively low number of clinical trials. The 
      future potential of digital diagnostics appears to be mostly related to the 
      subdiscipline of fixed prosthodontics, especially regarding virtual treatment 
      simulation for communication with the patient and among dental professionals. 
      Artificial intelligence emerged as a key technology in many of the identified 
      studies. Further research in this area is needed to explore the capabilities of 
      digital technologies in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning.

AB  - Panoramic radiographs are an integral part of effective dental treatment 
      planning, supporting dentists in identifying impacted teeth, infections, 
      malignancies, and other dental issues. However, screening for anomalies solely 
      based on a dentist's assessment may result in diagnostic inconsistency, posing 
      difficulties in developing a successful treatment plan. Recent advancements in 
      deep learning-based segmentation and object detection algorithms have enabled the 
      provision of predictable and practical identification to assist in the evaluation 
      of a patient's mineralized oral health, enabling dentists to construct a more 
      successful treatment plan. However, there has been a lack of efforts to develop 
      collaborative models that enhance learning performance by leveraging individual 
      models. The article describes a novel technique for enabling collaborative 
      learning by incorporating tooth segmentation and identification models created 
      independently from panoramic radiographs. This collaborative technique permits 
      the aggregation of tooth segmentation and identification to produce enhanced 
      results by recognizing and numbering existing teeth (up to 32 teeth). The 
      experimental findings indicate that the proposed collaborative model is 
      significantly more effective than individual learning models (e.g., 98.77% vs. 
      96% and 98.44% vs.91% for tooth segmentation and recognition, respectively). 
      Additionally, our models outperform the state-of-the-art segmentation and 
      identification research. We demonstrated the effectiveness of collaborative 
      learning in detecting and segmenting teeth in a variety of complex situations, 
      including healthy dentition, missing teeth, orthodontic treatment in progress, 
      and dentition with dental implants.

LID - 10.1111/ocr.12281 [doi]
AB  - Clinical applications of 3D image registration and superimposition have 
      contributed to better understanding growth changes and clinical outcomes. The use 
      of 3D dental and craniofacial imaging in dentistry requires validate image 
      analysis methods for improved diagnosis, treatment planning, navigation and 
      assessment of treatment response. Volumetric 3D images, such as cone-beam 
      computed tomography, can now be superimposed by voxels, surfaces or landmarks. 
      Regardless of the image modality or the software tools, the concepts of regions 
      or points of reference affect all quantitative of qualitative assessments. This 
      study reviews current state of the art in 3D image analysis including 3D 
      superimpositions relative to the cranial base and different regional 
      superimpositions, the development of open source and commercial tools for 3D 
      analysis, how this technology has increased clinical research collaborations from 
      centres all around the globe, some insight on how to incorporate artificial 
      intelligence for big data analysis and progress towards personalized 
      orthodontics.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Radiomics for Endometrial Cancer MRI: Exploring the 
      Whats, Whys and Hows.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13010226 [doi]
LID - 226
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is intricately linked to obesity and diabetes, which are 
      widespread risk factors. Medical imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI), plays a major role in EC assessment, particularly for disease staging. 
      However, the diagnostic performance of MRI exhibits variability in the detection 
      of clinically relevant prognostic factors (e.g., deep myometrial invasion and 
      metastatic lymph nodes assessment). To address these challenges and enhance the 
      value of MRI, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms emerge as 
      promising tools with a potential to impact EC risk assessment, treatment 
      planning, and prognosis prediction. These advanced post-processing techniques 
      allow us to quantitatively analyse medical images, providing novel insights into 
      cancer characteristics beyond conventional qualitative image evaluation. However, 
      despite the growing interest and research efforts, the integration of radiomics 
      and AI to EC management is still far from clinical practice and represents a 
      possible perspective rather than an actual reality. This review focuses on the 
      state of radiomics and AI in EC MRI, emphasizing risk stratification and 
      prognostic factor prediction, aiming to illuminate potential advancements and 
      address existing challenges in the field.

TI  - Deep Learning for Clinical Image Analyses in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A 
      Review.
PG  - 893-900
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.2028 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a lethal malignant neoplasm 
      with a high rate of tumor metastasis and recurrence. Accurate diagnosis, 
      prognosis prediction, and metastasis detection can improve patient outcomes. Deep 
      learning for clinical image analysis can be used for diagnosis and prognosis in 
      cancers, including oral SCC; its use in these areas can improve patient care and 
      outcome. OBSERVATIONS: This review is a summary of the use of deep learning 
      models for diagnosis, prognosis, and metastasis detection for oral SCC by 
      analyzing information from pathological and radiographic images. Specifically, 
      deep learning has been used to classify different cell types, to differentiate 
      cancer cells from nonmalignant cells, and to identify oral SCC from other cancer 
      types. It can also be used to predict survival, to differentiate between tumor 
      grades, and to detect lymph node metastasis. In general, the performance of these 
      deep learning models has an accuracy ranging from 77.89% to 97.51% and 76% to 
      94.2% with the use of pathological and radiographic images, respectively. The 
      review also discusses the importance of using good-quality clinical images in 
      sufficient quantity on model performance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Applying 
      pathological and radiographic images in deep learning models for diagnosis and 
      prognosis of oral SCC has been explored, and most studies report results showing 
      good classification accuracy. The successful use of deep learning in these areas 
      has a high clinical translatability in the improvement of patient care.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in paediatric endocrinology: conflict or cooperation.
PG  - 209-221
LID - 10.1515/jpem-2023-0554 [doi]
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is transforming healthcare by automating 
      system tasks, assisting in diagnostics, predicting patient outcomes and 
      personalising patient care, founded on the ability to analyse vast datasets. In 
      paediatric endocrinology, AI has been developed for diabetes, for insulin dose 
      adjustment, detection of hypoglycaemia and retinopathy screening; bone age 
      assessment and thyroid nodule screening; the identification of growth disorders; 
      the diagnosis of precocious puberty; and the use of facial recognition algorithms 
      in conditions such as Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, congenital adrenal 
      hyperplasia and Turner syndrome. AI can also predict those most at risk from 
      childhood obesity by stratifying future interventions to modify lifestyle. AI 
      will facilitate personalised healthcare by integrating data from 'omics' 
      analysis, lifestyle tracking, medical history, laboratory and imaging, therapy 
      response and treatment adherence from multiple sources. As data acquisition and 
      processing becomes fundamental, data privacy and protecting children's health 
      data is crucial. Minimising algorithmic bias generated by AI analysis for rare 
      conditions seen in paediatric endocrinology is an important determinant of AI 
      validity in clinical practice. AI cannot create the patient-doctor relationship 
      or assess the wider holistic determinants of care. Children have individual needs 
      and vulnerabilities and are considered in the context of family relationships and 
      dynamics. Importantly, whilst AI provides value through augmenting efficiency and 
      accuracy, it must not be used to replace clinical skills.

TI  - Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a Cephalometric Analysis: A 
      Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13162640 [doi]
LID - 2640
AB  - In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has become more 
      and more widespread in medicine and dentistry. It may contribute to improved 
      quality of health care as diagnostic methods are getting more accurate and 
      diagnostic errors are rarer in daily medical practice. The aim of this paper was 
      to present data from the literature on the effectiveness of AI in orthodontic 
      diagnostics based on the analysis of lateral cephalometric radiographs. A review 
      of the literature from 2009 to 2023 has been performed using PubMed, Medline, 
      Scopus and Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source databases. The accuracy of 
      determining cephalometric landmarks using widely available commercial AI-based 
      software and advanced AI algorithms was presented and discussed. Most AI 
      algorithms used for the automated positioning of landmarks on cephalometric 
      radiographs had relatively high accuracy. At the same time, the effectiveness of 
      using AI in cephalometry varies depending on the algorithm or the application 
      type, which has to be accounted for during the interpretation of the results. In 
      conclusion, artificial intelligence is a promising tool that facilitates the 
      identification of cephalometric landmarks in everyday clinical practice, may 
      support orthodontic treatment planning for less experienced clinicians and 
      shorten radiological examination in orthodontics. In the future, AI algorithms 
      used for the automated localisation of cephalometric landmarks may be more 
      accurate than manual analysis.

TI  - Machine Learning in Predicting Tooth Loss: A Systematic Review and Risk of Bias 
      Assessment.
LID - 10.3390/jpm12101682 [doi]
LID - 1682
AB  - Predicting tooth loss is a persistent clinical challenge in the 21st century. 
      While an emerging field in dentistry, computational solutions that employ machine 
      learning are promising for enhancing clinical outcomes, including the chairside 
      prognostication of tooth loss. We aimed to evaluate the risk of bias in 
      prognostic prediction models of tooth loss that use machine learning. To do this, 
      literature was searched in two electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed; Google 
      Scholar) for studies that reported the accuracy or area under the curve (AUC) of 
      prediction models. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the 
      entire receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. AUC provides an aggregate 
      measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. Although 
      both development and validation were included in this review, studies that did 
      not assess the accuracy or validation of boosting models (AdaBoosting, 
      Gradient-boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were excluded. Five 
      studies met criteria for inclusion and revealed high accuracy; however, models 
      displayed a high risk of bias. Importantly, patient-level assessments combined 
      with socioeconomic predictors performed better than clinical predictors alone. 
      While there are current limitations, machine-learning-assisted models for tooth 
      loss may enhance prognostication accuracy in combination with clinical and 
      patient metadata in the future.

AB  - Prosthodontics, deals in the restoration and replacement of missing and 
      structurally compromised teeth, this field has been remarkably transformed in the 
      last two decades. Through the integration of digital imaging and 
      three-dimensional printing, prosthodontics has evolved to provide more durable, 
      precise, and patient-centric outcome. However, as we stand at the convergence of 
      technology and healthcare, a new era is emerging, one that holds immense promise 
      for the field and that is artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we 
      explored the fascinating challenges and prospects associated with the future of 
      prosthodontics in the era of AI.

TI  - The Impetus of Artificial Intelligence on Periodontal Diagnosis: A Brief 
      Synopsis.

AB  - The current advances in digitized data additions, machine learning and computing 
      framework, lead to the swiftly emerging concept of "Artificial Intelligence" 
      (AI), that are developing into areas that were formerly contemplated for human 
      expertise. AI is a relatively rapid paced mechanics wherein the computer 
      technology is tuned to perform human tasks. An auxiliary domain of AI is machine 
      learning (ML), and Deep learning, a subclass of ML technique comprehends 
      multi-layer mathematical operations. AI-based applications have tremendous 
      potential to improve and systematize patient care thereby alleviating dentists 
      from laborious regular tasks, and facilitate personalized, predictive and 
      preventive dentistry. In the dental clinic, AI can execute a variety of easy 
      tasks with greater accuracy, minimal manpower, and with fewer mistakes over human 
      equivalents. These tasks range from appointment scheduling and coordination to 
      helping with clinical evaluation and therapy. Besides, this could assist in the 
      early diagnosis of dental and maxillofacial abnormalities like periodontal 
      ailments, root caries, bony lesions, and facial malformations in addition to 
      automatically identifying and classifying dental restorations on digital 
      radiographs. This brusque narrative review describes the AI-based systems, their 
      respective applications in periodontal diagnosis, the multifarious studies, 
      possible limitations and the predictable future of AI-based dental diagnostics 
      and treatment planning.

AB  - Dentistry based on artificial intelligence (AI) is not a myth but turning into a 
      reality. AI has revolutionized medicine and dentistry in various ways. AI is a 
      technology that uses machines to imitate intelligent human behavior. AI is 
      gaining popularity worldwide because of its significant impact and breakthrough 
      in the field of intelligence innovation. It is a lifesaver in dentistry, 
      particularly in the field of prosthodontics, because it aids in the design of 
      prostheses and the fabrication of functional maxillofacial appliances. It also 
      helps in the processes of patient documentation, diagnosis, treatment planning, 
      and patient management, allowing oral healthcare professionals to work smarter 
      rather than harder. While it cannot replace the work of a dentist because 
      dentistry is not about disease diagnosis, it does involve correlation with other 
      clinical findings and provides treatment to the patient. The integration of AI 
      and digitization has brought a new paradigm in dentistry, with extremely 
      promising prospects. The availability of insufficient and inaccurate data is now 
      the only barrier to the deployment of AI. Therefore, dentists and clinicians must 
      focus on collecting and entering authentic data into their database, which will 
      be completely utilized for AI in dentistry shortly. This study focuses on various 
      applications of AI in prosthodontics along with its limitations and future scope.

TI  - Machine Learning and Radiomics Applications in Esophageal Cancers Using 
      Non-Invasive Imaging Methods-A Critical Review of Literature.
LID - 10.3390/cancers13102469 [doi]
LID - 2469
AB  - Esophageal cancer (EC) is of public health significance as one of the leading 
      causes of cancer death worldwide. Accurate staging, treatment planning and 
      prognostication in EC patients are of vital importance. Recent advances in 
      machine learning (ML) techniques demonstrate their potential to provide novel 
      quantitative imaging markers in medical imaging. Radiomics approaches that could 
      quantify medical images into high-dimensional data have been shown to improve the 
      imaging-based classification system in characterizing the heterogeneity of 
      primary tumors and lymph nodes in EC patients. In this review, we aim to provide 
      a comprehensive summary of the evidence of the most recent developments in ML 
      application in imaging pertinent to EC patient care. According to the published 
      results, ML models evaluating treatment response and lymph node metastasis 
      achieve reliable predictions, ranging from acceptable to outstanding in their 
      validation groups. Patients stratified by ML models in different risk groups have 
      a significant or borderline significant difference in survival outcomes. 
      Prospective large multi-center studies are suggested to improve the 
      generalizability of ML techniques with standardized imaging protocols and 
      harmonization between different centers.

TI  - Machine Learning Predictive Model as Clinical Decision Support System in 
      Orthodontic Treatment Planning.
LID - 10.3390/dj11010001 [doi]
LID - 1
AB  - Diagnosis and treatment planning forms the crux of orthodontics, which 
      orthodontists gain with years of expertise. Machine Learning (ML), having the 
      ability to learn by pattern recognition, can gain this expertise in a very short 
      duration, ensuring reduced error, inter-intra clinician variability and good 
      accuracy. Thus, the aim of this study was to construct an ML predictive model to 
      predict a broader outline of the orthodontic diagnosis and treatment plan. The 
      sample consisted of 700 case records of orthodontically treated patients in the 
      past ten years. The data were split into a training and a test set. There were 33 
      input variables and 11 output variables. Four ML predictive model layers with 
      seven algorithms were created. The test set was used to check the efficacy of the 
      ML-predicted treatment plan and compared with that of the decision made by the 
      expert orthodontists. The model showed an overall average accuracy of 84%, with 
      the Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGB classifier algorithms showing the 
      highest accuracy ranging from 87-93%. Yet in their infancy stages, Machine 
      Learning models could become a valuable Clinical Decision Support System in 
      orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taking facial and intraoral clinical photos is one of the essential 
      parts of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Among the diagnostic 
      procedures, classification of the shuffled clinical photos with their 
      orientations will be the initial step while it was not easy for a machine to 
      classify photos with a variety of facial and dental situations. This article 
      presents a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) deep learning technique to 
      classify orthodontic clinical photos according to their orientations. METHODS: To 
      build an automated classification system, CNNs models of facial and intraoral 
      categories were constructed, and the clinical photos that are routinely taken for 
      orthodontic diagnosis were used to train the models with data augmentation. 
      Prediction procedures were evaluated with separate photos whose purpose was only 
      for prediction. RESULTS: Overall, a 98.0% valid prediction rate resulted for both 
      facial and intraoral photo classification. The highest prediction rate was 100% 
      for facial lateral profile, intraoral upper, and lower photos. CONCLUSION: An 
      artificial intelligence system that utilizes deep learning with proper training 
      models can successfully classify orthodontic facial and intraoral photos 
      automatically. This technique can be used for the first step of a fully automated 
      orthodontic diagnostic system in the future.

LID - 643
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intra-oral scans and gypsum cast scans (OS) are widely used in 
      orthodontics, prosthetics, implantology, and orthognathic surgery to plan 
      patient-specific treatments, which require teeth segmentations with high accuracy 
      and resolution. Manual teeth segmentation, the gold standard up until now, is 
      time-consuming, tedious, and observer-dependent. This study aims to develop an 
      automated teeth segmentation and labeling system using deep learning. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: As a reference, 1750 OS were manually segmented and labeled. A 
      deep-learning approach based on PointCNN and 3D U-net in combination with a 
      rule-based heuristic algorithm and a combinatorial search algorithm was trained 
      and validated on 1400 OS. Subsequently, the trained algorithm was applied to a 
      test set consisting of 350 OS. The intersection over union (IoU), as a measure of 
      accuracy, was calculated to quantify the degree of similarity between the 
      annotated ground truth and the model predictions. RESULTS: The model achieved 
      accurate teeth segmentations with a mean IoU score of 0.915. The FDI labels of 
      the teeth were predicted with a mean accuracy of 0.894. The optical inspection 
      showed excellent position agreements between the automatically and manually 
      segmented teeth components. Minor flaws were mostly seen at the edges. 
      CONCLUSION: The proposed method forms a promising foundation for time-effective 
      and observer-independent teeth segmentation and labeling on intra-oral scans. 
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Deep learning may assist clinicians in virtual treatment 
      planning in orthodontics, prosthetics, implantology, and orthognathic surgery. 
      The impact of using such models in clinical practice should be explored.

TI  - CBCT for Diagnostics, Treatment Planning and Monitoring of Sinus Floor Elevation 
      Procedures.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13101684 [doi]
LID - 1684
AB  - Sinus floor elevation (SFE) is a standard surgical technique used to compensate 
      for alveolar bone resorption in the posterior maxilla. Such a surgical procedure 
      requires radiographic imaging pre- and postoperatively for diagnosis, treatment 
      planning, and outcome assessment. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become 
      a well-established imaging modality in the dentomaxillofacial region. The 
      following narrative review is aimed to provide clinicians with an overview of the 
      role of three-dimensional (3D) CBCT imaging for diagnostics, treatment planning, 
      and postoperative monitoring of SFE procedures. CBCT imaging prior to SFE 
      provides surgeons with a more detailed view of the surgical site, allows for the 
      detection of potential pathologies three-dimensionally, and helps to virtually 
      plan the procedure more precisely while reducing patient morbidity. In addition, 
      it serves as a useful follow-up tool for assessing sinus and bone graft changes. 
      Meanwhile, using CBCT imaging has to be standardized and justified based on the 
      recognized diagnostic imaging guidelines, taking into account both the technical 
      and clinical considerations. Future studies are recommended to incorporate 
      artificial intelligence-based solutions for automating and standardizing the 
      diagnostic and decision-making process in the context of SFE procedures to 
      further improve the standards of patient care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Automatically detecting dental conditions using Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and reporting it visually are now a need for treatment planning 
      and dental health management. This work presents a comprehensive computer-aided 
      detection system to detect dental restorations. METHODS: The state-of-art ten 
      different deep-learning detection models were used including R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, 
      SSD, YOLOv3, and RetinaNet as detectors. ResNet-50, ResNet-101, XCeption-101, 
      VGG16, and DarkNet53 were integrated as backbone and feature extractor in 
      addition to efficient approaches such Side-Aware Boundary Localization, cascaded 
      structures and simple model frameworks like Libra and Dynamic.Total 684 objects 
      in panoramic radiographs were used to detect available three classes, namely, 
      dental restorations, denture and implant.Each model was evaluated by mean average 
      precision (mAP), average recall (AR), and precision-recall curve using Common 
      Objects in Context (COCO) detection evaluation metrics. RESULTS: mAP varied 
      between 0.755 and 0.973 for ten models explored while AR ranges between 0.605 and 
      0.771. Faster R-CNN RegnetX provided the best detection performance with mAP of 
      0.973 and AR of 0.771. Area under precision-recall curve was 0.952. 
      Precision-recall curve indicated that errors were mainly dominated by 
      localization confusions. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that the proposed AI-based 
      computer-aided system had great potential with reliable, accurate performance 
      detecting dental restorations, denture and implant in panoramic radiographs. As 
      training models with more data and standardization in reporting, AI-based 
      solutions will be implemented to dental clinics for daily use soon.

TI  - Personalized workflows in reconstructive dentistry-current possibilities and 
      future opportunities.
PG  - 4283-4290
LID - 10.1007/s00784-022-04475-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The increasing collection of health data coupled with continuous IT 
      advances have enabled precision medicine with personalized workflows. 
      Traditionally, dentistry has lagged behind general medicine in the integration of 
      new technologies: So what is the status quo of precision dentistry? The primary 
      focus of this review is to provide a current overview of personalized workflows 
      in the discipline of reconstructive dentistry (prosthodontics) and to highlight 
      the disruptive potential of novel technologies for dentistry; the possible impact 
      on society is also critically discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative 
      literature review. RESULTS: Narrative literature review. CONCLUSIONS: In the near 
      future, artificial intelligence (AI) will increase diagnostic accuracy, simplify 
      treatment planning, and thus contribute to the development of personalized 
      reconstructive workflows by analyzing e-health data to promote decision-making on 
      an individual patient basis. Dental education will also benefit from AI systems 
      for personalized curricula considering the individual students' skills. Augmented 
      reality (AR) will facilitate communication with patients and improve clinical 
      workflows through the use of visually guided protocols. Tele-dentistry will 
      enable opportunities for remote contact among dental professionals and facilitate 
      remote patient consultations and post-treatment follow-up using digital devices. 
      Finally, a personalized digital dental passport encoded using blockchain 
      technology could enable prosthetic rehabilitation using 3D-printed dental 
      biomaterials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, AI can be seen as the door-opener 
      and driving force for the evolution from evidence-based prosthodontics to 
      personalized reconstructive dentistry encompassing a synoptic approach with 
      prosthetic and implant workflows. Nevertheless, ethical concerns need to be 
      solved and international guidelines for data management and computing power must 
      be established prior to a widespread routine implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical field has the 
      potential to bring about significant improvements in patient care and outcomes. 
      AI is being used in dentistry and more specifically in orthodontics through the 
      development of diagnostic imaging tools, the development of treatment planning 
      tools, and the development of robotic surgery. The aim of this study is to 
      present the latest emerging AI softwares and applications in dental field to 
      benefit from. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: Search strategies were conducted in 
      three electronic databases, with no date limits in the following databases up to 
      April 30, 2023: MEDLINE, PUBMED, and GOOGLE® SCHOLAR for articles related to AI 
      in dentistry & orthodontics. No inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for 
      the selection of the articles. Most of the articles included (n = 79) are reviews 
      of the literature, retro/prospective studies, systematic reviews and 
      meta-analyses, and observational studies. RESULTS: The use of AI in dentistry and 
      orthodontics is a rapidly growing area of research and development, with the 
      potential to revolutionize the field and bring about significant improvements in 
      patient care and outcomes; this can save clinicians' chair-time and push for more 
      individualized treatment plans. Results from the various studies reported in this 
      review are suggestive that the accuracy of AI-based systems is quite promising 
      and reliable. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: AI application in the healthcare field has 
      proven to be efficient and helpful for the dentist to be more precise in 
      diagnosis and clinical decision-making. These systems can simplify the tasks and 
      provide results in quick time which can save dentists time and help them perform 
      their duties more efficiently. These systems can be of greater aid and can be 
      used as auxiliary support for dentists with lesser experience.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Machine learning platforms are now being introduced into modern 
      oncological practice for classification and prediction of patient outcomes. To 
      determine the current status of the application of these learning models as 
      adjunctive decision-making tools in oral cavity cancer management, this 
      systematic review aims to summarize the accuracy of machine-learning based models 
      for disease outcomes. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, 
      EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, SciELO, PsychINFO, and Web of Science were 
      searched up until December 21, 2020. Pertinent articles detailing the development 
      and accuracy of machine learning prediction models for oral cavity cancer 
      outcomes were selected in a two-stage process. Quality assessment was conducted 
      using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool and results of base studies 
      were qualitatively synthesized by all authors. Outcomes of interest were 
      malignant transformation of precancer lesions, cervical lymph node metastasis, as 
      well as treatment response, and prognosis of oral cavity cancer. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-seven articles out of 950 citations identified from electronic and manual 
      searching were included in this study. Five studies had low bias concerns on the 
      QUIPS tool. Prediction of malignant transformation, cervical lymph node 
      metastasis, treatment response, and prognosis were reported in three, six, eight, 
      and eleven articles respectively. Accuracy of these learning models on the 
      internal or external validation sets ranged from 0.85 to 0.97 for malignant 
      transformation prediction, 0.78-0.91 for cervical lymph node metastasis 
      prediction, 0.64-1.00 for treatment response prediction, and 0.71-0.99 for 
      prognosis prediction. In general, most trained algorithms predicting these 
      outcomes performed better than alternate methods of prediction. We also found 
      that models including molecular markers in training data had better accuracy 
      estimates for malignant transformation, treatment response, and prognosis 
      prediction. CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms have a satisfactory to 
      excellent accuracy for predicting three of four oral cavity cancer outcomes i.e., 
      malignant transformation, nodal metastasis, and prognosis. However, considering 
      the training approach of many available classifiers, these models may not be 
      streamlined enough for clinical application currently.

AB  - The increasing use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques in dental 
      medicine has boosted the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
      systems for various clinical problems. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and 
      intraoral/facial scans are potential sources of image data to develop 3D 
      image-based AI systems for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and 
      prediction of treatment outcome. This review focuses on current developments and 
      performance of AI for 3D imaging in dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR) as well 
      as intraoral and facial scanning. In DMFR, machine learning-based algorithms 
      proposed in the literature focus on three main applications, including automated 
      diagnosis of dental and maxillofacial diseases, localization of anatomical 
      landmarks for orthodontic and orthognathic treatment planning, and general 
      improvement of image quality. Automatic recognition of teeth and diagnosis of 
      facial deformations using AI systems based on intraoral and facial scanning will 
      very likely be a field of increased interest in the future. The review is aimed 
      at providing dental practitioners and interested colleagues in healthcare with a 
      comprehensive understanding of the current trend of AI developments in the field 
      of 3D imaging in dental medicine.

TI  - Research routes on improved sleep bruxism metrics: Toward a standardised 
      approach.
PG  - e13320
LID - 10.1111/jsr.13320 [doi]
AB  - A recent report from the European Sleep Research Society's task force "Beyond 
      AHI" discussed an issue that has been a long-term subject of debate - what are 
      the best metrics for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) diagnosis and treatment 
      outcome assessments? In a similar way, sleep bruxism (SB) metrics have also been 
      a recurrent issue for >30 years and there is still uncertainty in dentistry 
      regarding their optimisation and clinical relevance. SB can occur alone or with 
      comorbidities such as OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, insomnia, headache, 
      orofacial pain, periodic limb movement, rapid eye movement behaviour disorder, 
      and sleep epilepsy. Classically, the diagnosis of SB is based on the patient's 
      dental and medical history and clinical manifestations; electromyography is used 
      in research and for complex cases. The emergence of new technologies, such as 
      sensors and artificial intelligence, has opened new opportunities. The main 
      objective of the present review is to stimulate the creation of a collaborative 
      taskforce on SB metrics. Several examples are available in sleep medicine. The 
      development of more homogenised metrics could improve the accuracy and refinement 
      of SB assessment, while moving forward toward a personalised approach. It is time 
      to develop SB metrics that are relevant to clinical outcomes and benefit patients 
      who suffer from one or more possible negative consequences of SB.

PG  - 686863

AB  - The application of deep machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, 
      has become a growing area of interest in predictive medicine in recent years. The 
      deep machine learning approach has been used to analyze imaging and radiomics and 
      to develop models that have the potential to assist the clinicians to make an 
      informed and guided decision that can assist to improve patient outcomes. 
      Improved prognostication of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) will greatly 
      benefit the clinical management of oral cancer patients. This review examines the 
      recent development in the field of deep learning for OSCC prognostication. The 
      search was carried out using five different databases-PubMed, Scopus, 
      OvidMedline, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers 
      (IEEE). The search was carried time from inception until 15 May 2021. There were 
      34 studies that have used deep machine learning for the prognostication of OSCC. 
      The majority of these studies used a convolutional neural network (CNN). This 
      review showed that a range of novel imaging modalities such as computed 
      tomography (or enhanced computed tomography) images and spectra data have shown 
      significant applicability to improve OSCC outcomes. The average specificity, 
      sensitivity, area under receiving operating characteristics curve [AUC]), and 
      accuracy for studies that used spectra data were 0.97, 0.99, 0.96, and 96.6%, 
      respectively. Conversely, the corresponding average values for these parameters 
      for computed tomography images were 0.84, 0.81, 0.967, and 81.8%, respectively. 
      Ethical concerns such as privacy and confidentiality, data and model bias, peer 
      disagreement, responsibility gap, patient-clinician relationship, and patient 
      autonomy have limited the widespread adoption of these models in daily clinical 
      practices. The accumulated evidence indicates that deep machine learning models 
      have great potential in the prognostication of OSCC. This approach offers a more 
      generic model that requires less data engineering with improved accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cephalometric analysis is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning 
      and outcome assessment of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Utilizing 
      artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve automated landmark localization has 
      proved feasible and convenient. However, current systems remain insufficient for 
      clinical application, as patients exhibit various malocclusions in cephalograms 
      produced by different manufacturers while limited cephalograms were applied to 
      train AI in these systems. METHODS: A robust and clinically applicable AI system 
      was proposed for automatic cephalometric analysis. First, 9870 cephalograms taken 
      by different radiography machines with various malocclusions of patients were 
      collected from 20 medical institutions. Then 30 landmarks of all these 
      cephalogram samples were manually annotated to train an AI system, composed of a 
      two-stage convolutional neural network and a software-as-a-service system. 
      Further, more than 100 orthodontists participated to refine the AI-output 
      landmark localizations and retrain this system. RESULTS: The average landmark 
      prediction error of this system was as low as 0.94 ± 0.74 mm and the system 
      achieved an average classification accuracy of 89.33%. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic 
      cephalometric analysis system based on convolutional neural network was proposed, 
      which can realize automatic landmark location and cephalometric measurements 
      classification. This system showed promise in improving diagnostic efficiency in 
      clinical circumstances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of Class III (Cl III) dentoskeletal phenotype is often 
      expert-driven. PURPOSE: The aim is to identify critical morphological features in 
      postcircumpubertal Cl III treatment and appraise the predictive ability of 
      innovative machine learning (ML) algorithms for adult Cl III malocclusion 
      treatment planning. STUDY DESIGN: The Orthodontics Department at the University 
      of Illinois Chicago undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study analyzing Cl 
      III malocclusion cases (2003-2020) through dental records and pretreatment 
      lateral cephalograms. PREDICTOR: Forty features were identified through a 
      literature review and gathered from pretreatment records, serving as ML model 
      inputs. Eight ML models were trained to predict the best treatment for adult Cl 
      III malocclusion. OUTCOME VARIABLE: Predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      specificity of the models, along with the highest-contributing features, were 
      evaluated for performance assessment. COVARIATES: Demographic covariates, 
      including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were assessed. Inclusion criteria 
      targeted patients with cervical vertebral maturation stage 4 or above. Operative 
      covariates such as tooth extraction and types of orthognathic surgical maneuvers 
      were also analyzed. ANALYSES: Demographic characteristics of the camouflage and 
      surgical study groups were described statistically. Shapiro-Wilk Normality test 
      was employed to check data distribution. Differences in means between groups were 
      evaluated using parametric and nonparametric independent sample tests, with 
      statistical significance set at <0.05. RESULTS: The study involved 182 
      participants; 65 underwent camouflage mechanotherapy, and 117 received 
      orthognathic surgery. No statistical differences were found in demographic 
      characteristics between the two groups (P > .05). Extreme values of pretreatment 
      parameters suggested a surgical approach. Artificial neural network algorithms 
      predicted treatment approach with 91% accuracy, while the Extreme Gradient 
      Boosting model achieved 93% accuracy after recursive feature elimination 
      optimization. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model highlighted Wit's appraisal, 
      anterior overjet, and Mx/Md ratio as key predictors. CONCLUSIONS: The research 
      identified significant cephalometric differences between Cl III adults requiring 
      orthodontic camouflage or surgery. A 93% accurate artificial intelligence model 
      was formulated based on these insights, highlighting the potential role of 
      artificial intelligence and ML as adjunct tools in orthodontic diagnosis and 
      treatment planning. This may assist in minimizing clinician subjectivity in 
      borderline cases.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) has a unique histopathology compared with other head 
      and neck cancers. Individual NPC patients may attain different outcomes. This 
      study aims to build a prognostic system by combining a highly accurate machine 
      learning model (ML) model with explainable artificial intelligence to stratify 
      NPC patients into low and high chance of survival groups. Explainability is 
      provided using Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley 
      Additive exPlanations (SHAP) techniques. A total of 1094 NPC patients were 
      retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database 
      for model training and internal validation. We combined five different ML 
      algorithms to form a uniquely stacked algorithm. The predictive performance of 
      the stacked algorithm was compared with a state-of-the-art algorithm-extreme 
      gradient boosting (XGBoost) to stratify the NPC patients into chance of survival 
      groups. We validated our model with temporal validation (n = 547) and geographic 
      external validation (Helsinki University Hospital NPC cohort, n = 60). The 
      developed stacked predictive ML model showed an accuracy of 85.9% while the 
      XGBoost had 84.5% after the training and testing phases. This demonstrated that 
      both XGBoost and the stacked model showed comparable performance. External 
      geographic validation of XGBoost model showed a c-index of 0.74, accuracy of 
      76.7%, and area under curve of 0.76. The SHAP technique revealed that age of the 
      patient at diagnosis, T-stage, ethnicity, M-stage, marital status, and grade were 
      among the prominent input variables in decreasing order of significance for the 
      overall survival of NPC patients. LIME showed the degree of reliability of the 
      prediction made by the model. In addition, both techniques showed how each 
      feature contributed to the prediction made by the model. LIME and SHAP techniques 
      provided personalized protective and risk factors for each NPC patient and 
      unraveled some novel non-linear relationships between input features and survival 
      chance. The examined ML approach showed the ability to predict the chance of 
      overall survival of NPC patients. This is important for effective treatment 
      planning care and informed clinical decisions. To enhance outcome results, 
      including survival in NPC, ML may aid in planning individualized therapy for this 
      patient population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tooth segmentation on cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging 
      is a labor-intensive task considering the limited contrast resolution and 
      potential disturbance by various artifacts. Fully automated tooth segmentation 
      cannot be achieved by merely relying on CBCT intensity variations. This study 
      aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tool for 
      automated tooth segmentation on CBCT imaging. METHODS: A total of 433 Digital 
      Imaging and Communications in Medicine images of single- and double-rooted teeth 
      randomly selected from 314 anonymized CBCT scans were imported and manually 
      segmented. An AI-driven tooth segmentation algorithm based on a feature pyramid 
      network was developed to automatically detect and segment teeth, replacing manual 
      user contour placement. The AI-driven tool was evaluated based on volume 
      comparison, intersection over union, the Dice score coefficient, morphologic 
      surface deviation, and total segmentation time. RESULTS: Overall, AI-driven and 
      clinical reference segmentations resulted in very similar segmentation volumes. 
      The mean intersection over union for full-tooth segmentation was 0.87 (±0.03) and 
      0.88 (±0.03) for semiautomated (SA) (clinical reference) versus fully automated 
      AI-driven (F-AI) and refined AI-driven (R-AI) tooth segmentation, respectively. 
      R-AI and F-AI segmentation showed an average median surface deviation from SA 
      segmentation of 9.96 μm (±59.33 μm) and 7.85 μm (±69.55 μm), respectively. SA 
      segmentations of single- and double-rooted teeth had a mean total time of 6.6 
      minutes (±76.15 seconds), F-AI segmentation of 0.5 minutes (±8.64 seconds, 12 
      times faster), and R-AI segmentation of 1.2 minutes (±33.02 seconds, 6 times 
      faster). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a unique fast and accurate approach for 
      AI-driven automated tooth segmentation on CBCT imaging. These results may open 
      doors for AI-driven applications in surgical and treatment planning in oral 
      health care.

TI  - Deep Learning for Dental Diagnosis: A Novel Approach to Furcation Involvement 
      Detection on Periapical Radiographs.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10070802 [doi]
LID - 802
AB  - Furcation defects pose a significant challenge in the diagnosis and treatment 
      planning of periodontal diseases. The accurate detection of furcation 
      involvements (FI) on periapical radiographs (PAs) is crucial for the success of 
      periodontal therapy. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach to 
      furcation defect detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an 
      accuracy rate of 95%. This research has undergone a rigorous review by the 
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has received accreditation under number 
      202002030B0C505. A dataset of 300 periapical radiographs of teeth with and 
      without FI were collected and preprocessed to enhance the quality of the images. 
      The efficient and innovative image masking technique used in this research better 
      enhances the contrast between FI symptoms and other areas. Moreover, this 
      technology highlights the region of interest (ROI) for the subsequent CNN models 
      training with a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. The 
      proposed segmentation algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance with an 
      overall accuracy up to 94.97%, surpassing other conventional methods. Moreover, 
      in comparison with existing CNN technology for identifying dental problems, this 
      research proposes an improved adaptive threshold preprocessing technique that 
      produces clearer distinctions between teeth and interdental molars. The proposed 
      model achieves impressive results in detecting FI with identification rates 
      ranging from 92.96% to a remarkable 94.97%. These findings suggest that our deep 
      learning approach holds significant potential for improving the accuracy and 
      efficiency of dental diagnosis. Such AI-assisted dental diagnosis has the 
      potential to improve periodontal diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient 
      outcomes. This research demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using 
      deep learning algorithms for furcation defect detection on periapical radiographs 
      and highlights the potential for AI-assisted dental diagnosis. With the 
      improvement of dental abnormality detection, earlier intervention could be 
      enabled and could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Multi-model Deep Learning approach for segmentation of teeth and periapical 
      lesions on Pantomographs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fields of medicine and dentistry are beginning to integrate 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diagnostics. This may reduce subjectivity and 
      improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment planning. Current evidence on 
      pathosis detection on Pantomographs(PGs) indicates the presence or absence of 
      disease in the entire radiographic image, with little evidence of the relation of 
      periapical pathosis to the causative tooth. OBJECTIVE: To develop a Deep Learning 
      (DL) AI model for the segmentation of periapical pathosis and its relation to 
      teeth on PGs. METHOD: 250 PGs were manually annotated by subject experts to lay 
      down the ground truth for training AI algorithms on the segmentation of 
      periapical pathosis. Two approaches were used for lesion detection: Multi-models 
      1 and 2, using U-net and Mask RCNN algorithms, respectively. The resulting 
      segmented lesions generated on the testing data set were superimposed with 
      results of teeth segmentation and numbering algorithms trained separately to 
      relate lesions to causative teeth. Hence, both multi-model approaches related 
      periapical pathosis to the causative teeth on PGs. RESULTS: The performance 
      metrics of lesion segmentation carried out by U-net are as follows: Accuracy = 
      98.1%, precision = 84.5%, re-call = 80.3%, F-1 score = 82.2%, dice index = 75.2%, 
      and Intersection over Union = 67.6%. Mask RCNN carried out lesion segmentation 
      with an accuracy of 46.7%, precision of 80.6%, recall of 55%, and F-1 score of 
      63.1%. CONCLUSION: In this study, the multi-model approach successfully related 
      periapical pathosis to the causative tooth on PGs. However, U-net outperformed 
      Mask RCNN in the tasks performed, suggesting that U-net will remain the standard 
      for medical image segmentation tasks. Further training of the models on other 
      findings and an increased number of images will lead to the automation of the 
      detection of common radiographic findings in the dental diagnostic workflow.

AB  - AIM: To develop a deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for 
      instance segmentation and tooth numbering on orthopantomograms (OPGs). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Forty OPGs were manually annotated to lay down the ground truth for 
      training two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): U-net and Faster RCNN. These 
      algorithms were concurrently trained and validated on a dataset of 1280 teeth (40 
      OPGs) each. The U-net algorithm was trained on OPGs specifically annotated with 
      polygons to label all 32 teeth via instance segmentation, allowing each tooth to 
      be denoted as a separate entity from the surrounding structures. Simultaneously, 
      teeth were also numbered according to the Fédération Dentaire Internationale 
      (FDI) numbering system, using bounding boxes to train Faster RCNN. Consequently, 
      both trained CNNs were combined to develop an AI model capable of segmenting and 
      numbering all teeth on an OPG. RESULTS: The performance of the U-net algorithm 
      was determined using various performance metrics including precision = 88.8%, 
      accuracy = 88.2%, recall = 87.3%, F-1 score = 88%, dice index = 92.3%, and 
      Intersection over Union (IoU) = 86.3%. The performance metrics of the Faster RCNN 
      algorithm were determined using overlap accuracy = 30.2 bounding boxes (out of a 
      possible of 32 boxes) and classifier accuracy of labels = 93.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      instance segmentation and tooth numbering results of our trained AI model were 
      close to the ground truth, indicating a promising future for their incorporation 
      into clinical dental practice. The ability of an AI model to automatically 
      identify teeth on OPGs will aid dentists with diagnosis and treatment planning, 
      thus increasing efficiency.

AB  - Ischemia reperfusion injury is a common precipitant of acute kidney injury that 
      occurs following disrupted perfusion to the kidney. This includes blood loss and 
      hemodynamic shock, as well as during retrieval for deceased donor kidney 
      transplantation. Acute kidney injury is associated with adverse long-term 
      clinical outcomes and requires effective interventions that can modify the 
      disease process. Immunomodulatory cell therapies such as tolerogenic dendritic 
      cells remain a promising tool, and here we tested the hypothesis that adoptively 
      transferred tolerogenic dendritic cells can limit kidney injury. The phenotypic 
      and genomic signatures of bone marrow-derived syngeneic or allogeneic, 
      Vitamin-D3/IL-10-conditioned tolerogenic dendritic cells were assessed. These 
      cells were characterized by high PD-L1:CD86, elevated IL-10, restricted IL-12p70 
      secretion and a suppressed transcriptomic inflammatory profile. When infused 
      systemically, these cells successfully abrogated kidney injury without modifying 
      infiltrating inflammatory cell populations. They also provided protection against 
      ischemia reperfusion injury in mice pre-treated with liposomal clodronate, 
      suggesting the process was regulated by live, rather than reprocessed cells. 
      Co-culture experiments and spatial transcriptomic analysis confirmed reduced 
      kidney tubular epithelial cell injury. Thus, our data provide strong evidence 
      that peri-operatively administered tolerogenic dendritic cells have the ability 
      to protect against acute kidney injury and warrants further exploration as a 
      therapeutic option. This technology may provide a clinical advantage for 
      bench-to-bedside translation to affect patient outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental radiographs are essential in the diagnostic process in 
      dentistry. They serve various purposes, including determining age, analyzing 
      patterns of tooth eruption/shedding, and treatment planning and prognosis. The 
      emergence of digital radiography technology has piqued interest in using 
      artificial intelligence systems to assist and guide dental professionals. These 
      cutting-edge technologies assist in streamlining decision-making processes by 
      enabling entity classification and localization tasks. With the integration of 
      artificial Intelligence algorithms tailored for pediatric dentistry applications 
      and utilizing automated tools, there is an optimistic outlook on improving 
      diagnostic capabilities while reducing stress and fatigue among clinicians. 
      METHODOLOGY: The dataset comprised 620 images (mixed dentition: 314, permanent 
      dentition: 306). Panoramic radiographs taken were within the age range of 4-16 
      years. The classification of deciduous and permanent teeth involved training 
      CNN-based models using different architectures such as Resnet, AlexNet, and 
      EfficientNet, among others. A ratio of 70:15:15 was utilized for training, 
      validation, and testing, respectively. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The findings 
      indicated that among the models proposed, EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 
      exhibited superior performance. Both EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 achieved 
      an accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98% in classifying teeth as 
      either deciduous or permanent. This implies that these models were highly 
      accurate in identifying patterns/features within the dataset used for evaluation.

TI  - Deep learning improves prediction of periodontal therapy effectiveness in Chinese 
      patients.
PG  - 520-528
LID - 10.1111/jre.13122 [doi]
AB  - THE OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose a new model to predict the specific 
      treatment effectiveness at site level by analyzing massive amounts of periodontal 
      clinical data with deep learning methods. THE BACKGROUND DATA DISCUSSING THE 
      PRESENT STATUS OF THE FIELD: In light of the low accuracy of current tools, the 
      proposed models cannot fully meet the needs of clinical effectiveness prediction 
      and cannot be applied to on site level prognosis development and formulation of 
      specific treatment plan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Periodontal examination data of 
      9273 Chinese patients were extracted and used to propose a Sequence-to-Sequence 
      model after performing data management and reconstruction. The model was 
      optimized by introducing the Attention mechanism. RESULTS: In the test set, the 
      model obtained an average site-level probing depth (PD) accuracy (defined as the 
      proportion of sites with <1 mm deviation of the predicted result from the true 
      value) of 92.4% and high sensitivity (98.6%) for the pocket closure variable. For 
      sites with baseline PD <5 mm, the model achieved a prediction accuracy of 94.6%, 
      while it decreased to 79.9% at sites with PD ≥5 mm. In contrast, for teeth with 
      initial mean PD ≥5 mm, the prediction accuracy significantly differed between 
      molars and non-molars. CONCLUSION: Our model is the first to predict the 
      site-level effectiveness with high accuracy and sensitivity. Future prediction

TI  - Assessment of AI Models in Predicting Treatment Outcomes in Orthodontics.
PG  - S540-S542
LID - 10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_852_23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the realm of orthodontics, the evaluation of treatment outcomes is 
      a pivotal aspect. In recent times, artificial intelligence (AI) models have 
      garnered attention as potential tools for predicting these outcomes. These AI 
      models have the potential to enhance treatment planning and decision-making 
      processes. However, a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness and 
      accuracy is essential before their widespread integration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      In this study, we assessed the capability of AI models to predict treatment 
      outcomes in orthodontics. A sample of 30 patients undergoing orthodontic 
      treatment was selected. Various patient-specific parameters, including age, 
      initial malocclusion severity, and treatment approach, were collected. The AI 
      model was trained using a dataset comprising historical treatment cases and their 
      respective outcomes. Subsequently, the trained AI model was applied to predict 
      the treatment outcomes for the selected patients. RESULTS: The results of this 
      study indicated a moderate level of accuracy in the predictions made by the AI 
      model. Out of the 30 patients, the model accurately predicted treatment outcomes 
      for 22 patients, yielding a success rate of approximately 73%. However, the model 
      exhibited limitations in accurately predicting outcomes for cases involving 
      complex malocclusions or those requiring non-standard treatment approaches. 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of AI models in 
      predicting treatment outcomes in orthodontics. While the AI model demonstrated 
      promising accuracy in the majority of cases, its efficacy was diminished in 
      complex and non-standard cases. Therefore, while AI models can serve as valuable 
      tools to aid orthodontists in treatment planning, they should be utilized in 
      conjunction with clinical expertise to ensure optimal decision-making and patient 
      care.

TI  - Health Data in Dentistry: An Attempt to Master the Digital Challenge.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1159/000501643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomedical research has recently moved through three stages in 
      digital healthcare: (1) data collection; (2) data sharing; and (3) data 
      analytics. With the explosion of stored health data (HD), dental medicine is 
      edging into its fourth stage of digitization using artificial intelligence (AI). 
      This narrative literature review outlines the challenge of managing HD and 
      anticipating the potential of AI in oral healthcare and dental research by 
      summarizing the current literature. SUMMARY: The basis of successful management 
      of HD is the establishment of a generally accepted data standard that will guide 
      its implementation within electronic health records (EHR) and health information 
      technology ecosystems (HIT Eco). Thereby continuously adapted (self-) learning 
      health systems (LHS) can be created. The HIT Eco of the future will combine (i) 
      the front-end utilization of HD in clinical decision-making by providers using 
      supportive diagnostic tools for patient-centered treatment planning, and (ii) 
      back-end algorithms analyzing the standardized collected data to inform 
      population-based policy decisions about resource allocations and research 
      directions. Cryptographic methods in blockchain enable a safe, more efficient, 
      and effective dental care within a global perspective. Key Message: The 
      interoperability of HD with accessible digital health technologies is the key to 
      deliver value-based dental care and exploit the tremendous potential of AI.

TI  - Machine learning-assisted immune profiling stratifies peri-implantitis patients 
      with unique microbial colonization and clinical outcomes.
PG  - 6703-6716
LID - 10.7150/thno.57775 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: The endemic of peri-implantitis affects over 25% of dental implants. 
      Current treatment depends on empirical patient and site-based stratifications and 
      lacks a consistent risk grading system. Methods: We investigated a unique cohort 
      of peri-implantitis patients undergoing regenerative therapy with comprehensive 
      clinical, immune, and microbial profiling. We utilized a robust outlier-resistant 
      machine learning algorithm for immune deconvolution. Results: Unsupervised 
      clustering identified risk groups with distinct immune profiles, microbial 
      colonization dynamics, and regenerative outcomes. Low-risk patients exhibited 
      elevated M1/M2-like macrophage ratios and lower B-cell infiltration. The low-risk 
      immune profile was characterized by enhanced complement signaling and higher 
      levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella 
      intermedia were significantly enriched in high-risk individuals. Although surgery 
      reduced microbial burden at the peri-implant interface in all groups, only 
      low-risk individuals exhibited suppression of keystone pathogen re-colonization. 
      Conclusion: Peri-implant immune microenvironment shapes microbial composition and 
      the course of regeneration. Immune signatures show untapped potential in 
      improving the risk-grading for peri-implantitis.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized in soft-tissue analysis and 
      prediction in orthodontic treatment planning, although its reliability has not 
      been systematically assessed. This scoping review was conducted to outline the 
      development of AI in terms of predicting soft-tissue changes after orthodontic 
      treatment, as well as to comprehensively evaluate its prediction accuracy. Six 
      electronic databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane 
      Library, and Scopus) were searched up to March 14, 2023. Clinical studies 
      investigating the performance of AI-based systems in predicting post-orthodontic 
      soft-tissue alterations were included. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic 
      Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal 
      checklist for diagnostic test accuracy studies were applied to assess risk of 
      bias, while the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluation (GRADE) assessment was conducted to evaluate the certainty of 
      outcomes. After screening 2500 studies, four non-randomized clinical trials were 
      finally included for full-text evaluation. We found a low level of evidence 
      indicating an estimated high overall accuracy of AI-generated prediction, whereas 
      the lower lip and chin seemed to be the least predictable regions. Furthermore, 
      the facial morphology simulated by AI via the fusion of multimodality images was 
      considered to be reasonably true. Since all of the included studies that were not 
      randomized clinical trials (non-RCTs) showed a moderate to high risk of bias, 
      more well-designed clinical trials with sufficient sample size are needed in 
      future work.

TI  - Imaging in Third Molar Surgery: A Clinical Update.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12247688 [doi]
LID - 7688
AB  - Third molar surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in 
      oral and maxillofacial surgery. Considering the patient's young age and the 
      often-elective nature of the procedure, a comprehensive preoperative evaluation 
      of the surgical site, relying heavily on preoperative imaging, is key to 
      providing accurate diagnostic work-up, evidence-based clinical decision making, 
      and, when appropriate, indication-specific surgical planning. Given the rapid 
      developments of dental imaging in the field, the aim of this article is to 
      provide a comprehensive, up-to-date clinical overview of various imaging 
      techniques related to perioperative imaging in third molar surgery, ranging from 
      panoramic radiography to emerging technologies, such as photon-counting computed 
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Each modality's advantages, 
      limitations, and recent improvements are evaluated, highlighting their role in 
      treatment planning, complication prevention, and postoperative follow-ups. The 
      integration of recent technological advances, including artificial intelligence 
      and machine learning in biomedical imaging, coupled with a thorough preoperative 
      clinical evaluation, marks another step towards personalized dentistry in 
      high-risk third molar surgery. This approach enables minimally invasive surgical 
      approaches while reducing inefficiencies and risks by incorporating additional 
      imaging modality- and patient-specific parameters, potentially facilitating and 
      improving patient management.

AB  - With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it has a wide 
      range of explorations in orthodontics. AI has greater application prospects in 
      precise measurement, multidimensional diagnosis, treatment planning and efficacy 
      prediction. At the same time, there are certain limitations in the application of 
      AI, such as risks caused by individual variability, black box properties and 
      unclear delineation of medical responsibilities. This paper summarized the 
      history and current status of AI applications in orthodontics and discussed 
      future development trends, to provide reference for clinical orthodontics.

AB  - In the digital dentistry era, new tools, algorithms, data science approaches, and 
      computer applications are available to researchers and clinicians. However, there 
      is also a strong need for better knowledge and understanding of multisource data 
      applications, including three-dimensional imaging information such as cone-beam 
      computed tomography images and digital dental models for multidisciplinary cases. 
      In addition, artificial intelligence models and automated clinical decision 
      systems are rising. The clinician needs to plan the treatment based on 
      state-of-the-art diagnosis for better and more personalized treatment. This 
      article aimed to review basic concepts and the current panorama of digital 
      implant planning in orthodontics, with open-source and closed-source tools for 
      assessing cone-beam computed images and digital dental models. The visualization 
      and processing of the three-dimensional data allow better implant planning based 
      on bone conditions, adjacent teeth and root positions, and the prognosis of the 
      case. We showed that many tools for assessment, segmentation, and visualization 
      of cone-beam computed tomographic images and digital dental models could 
      facilitate the treatment planning of patients needing implants or space closure. 
      The tools and approaches presented are toward personalized treatment and better 
      prognosis, following the path to a more automated clinical decision system based 
      on multisource three-dimensional data, artificial intelligence models, and 
      digital planning. In summary, the orthodontist needs to analyze each patient 
      individually and use different software or tools that better fit their practice, 
      allowing efficient treatment planning and satisfactory results with an adequate 
      prognosis.

AB  - Early prediction of patient mortality risks during a pandemic can decrease 
      mortality by assuring efficient resource allocation and treatment planning. This 
      study aimed to develop and compare prognosis prediction machine learning models 
      based on invasive laboratory and noninvasive clinical and demographic data from 
      patients' day of admission. Three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were 
      developed and compared using invasive, non-invasive, and both groups. The results 
      suggested that non-invasive features could provide mortality predictions that are 
      similar to the invasive and roughly on par with the joint model. Feature 
      inspection results from SVM-RFE and sparsity analysis displayed that, compared 
      with the invasive model, the non-invasive model can provide better performances 
      with a fewer number of features, pointing to the presence of high predictive 
      information contents in several non-invasive features, including SPO2, age, and 
      cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, while the invasive model was able to 
      provide better mortality predictions for the imminent future, non-invasive 
      features displayed better performance for more distant expiration intervals. 
      Early mortality prediction using non-invasive models can give us insights as to 
      where and with whom to intervene. Combined with novel technologies, such as 
      wireless wearable devices, these models can create powerful frameworks for 
      various medical assignments and patient triage.

AB  - Determining the severity of dental crowding and the necessity of tooth extraction 
      for orthodontic treatment planning are time-consuming processes and there are no 
      firm criteria. Thus, automated assistance would be useful to clinicians. This 
      study aimed to construct and evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) systems to 
      assist with such treatment planning. A total of 3,136 orthodontic occlusal 
      photographs with annotations by two orthodontists were obtained. Four 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) models, namely ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and 
      VGG19, were adopted for the AI process. Using the intraoral photographs as input, 
      the crowding group and the necessity of tooth extraction were obtained. Arch 
      length discrepancy analysis with AI-detected landmarks was used for crowding 
      categorization. Various statistical and visual analyses were conducted to 
      evaluate the performance. The maxillary and mandibular VGG19 models showed 
      minimum mean errors of 0.84 mm and 1.06 mm for teeth landmark detection, 
      respectively. Analysis of Cohen's weighted kappa coefficient indicated that 
      crowding categorization performance was best in VGG19 (0.73), decreasing in the 
      order of VGG16, ResNet101, and ResNet50. For tooth extraction, the maxillary 
      VGG19 model showed the highest accuracy (0.922) and AUC (0.961). By utilizing 
      deep learning with orthodontic photographs, dental crowding categorization and 
      diagnosis of orthodontic extraction were successfully determined. This suggests 
      that AI can assist clinicians in the diagnosis and decision making of treatment 
      plans.

LID - 10.1177/14653125231203743 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) in treatment planning 
      and outcome prediction in orthognathic treatment (OGT) has not been 
      systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of AI in treatment 
      planning and soft tissue outcome prediction in OGT. DESIGN: Systematic review. 
      DATA SOURCES: Unrestricted search of indexed databases and reference lists of 
      included studies. DATA SELECTION: Clinical studies that addressed the focused 
      question 'Is AI useful for treatment planning and soft tissue outcome prediction 
      in OGT?' were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Study screening, selection and data 
      extraction were performed independently by two authors. The risk of bias (RoB) 
      was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RoB and ROBINS-I tools for 
      randomised and non-randomised clinical studies, respectively. DATA SYNTHESIS: 
      Eight clinical studies (seven retrospective cohort studies and one randomised 
      controlled study) were included. Four studies assessed the role of AI for 
      treatment decision making; and four studies assessed the accuracy of AI in soft 
      tissue outcome prediction after OGT. In four studies, the level of agreement 
      between AI and non-AI decision making was found to be clinically acceptable (at 
      least 90%). In four studies, it was shown that AI can be used for soft tissue 
      outcome prediction after OGT; however, predictions were not clinically acceptable 
      for the lip and chin areas. All studies had a low to moderate RoB. LIMITATIONS: 
      Due to high methodological inconsistencies among the included studies, it was not 
      possible to conduct a meta-analysis and reporting biases assessment. CONCLUSION: 
      AI can be a useful aid to traditional treatment planning by facilitating clinical 
      treatment decision making and providing a visualisation tool for soft tissue 
      outcome prediction in OGT. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022366864.

AB  - Due to recent technological innovations, digital health is quickly transforming 
      the means of healthcare delivery. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
      wearables and virtual consultations are increasingly being integrated into 
      routine clinical care and with careful consideration; these promise to bring 
      improvements to both professional workloads and patient outcomes. We highlight 
      the need for dedicated digital health education in order to ensure appropriate 
      use of patient data, patient safeguarding and the means by which we might 
      incorporate this in a post-covid COVID curriculum. We comment on what can be 
      learnt by Barts X Medicine, the first digital health programme in England to be 
      integrated into the medical curriculum, to improve medical teaching.

TI  - Preparing the Next Generation of Clinicians for Practice Using Augmented and 
      Artificial Intelligence.
PG  - e1-e4
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and Augmented Intelligence (AuI) have existed for 
      decades but have only recently been applied to dentistry and incorporated into 
      higher education for dental professionals. Early examples of the incorporation of 
      AI into dental education suggest it can enhance students' learning and can be 
      applied in pre-clinical and clinical instruction. AI can be used to support 
      clinical decision-making for dental professionals, making radiographic 
      interpretation more precise and consistent. This paper provides a brief overview 
      of AI, highlights opportunities to improve higher education and provides brief 
      case studies of individuals and organizations working to advance the quality of 
      dental education using AI. Opportunities for the application of AI in dental 
      education include the adoption of clinical decision support that can improve 
      patient outcomes and overall quality of patient care; development of courses that 
      assist students in learning enhanced radiographic interpretation, diagnosis and 
      treatment planning; research collaborations with industry for product evaluation 
      and future product developments; and practice administration in understanding the 
      quality of the care being delivered at the school.

TI  - The validation of orthodontic artificial intelligence systems that perform 
      orthodontic diagnoses and treatment planning.
PG  - 436-444
LID - 10.1093/ejo/cjab083 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study was aimed to evaluate two artificial intelligence (AI) systems 
      that created a prioritized problem list and treatment plan, and examine whether 
      the performance of the aforementioned systems was equivalent to orthodontists. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 967 consecutive cases [800: training; 67: 
      validation; 100: evaluation (40: randomly selected for the clinical evaluation)] 
      were used. We used a stored document that describes (1) the patient's clinical 
      information, (2) the prioritized list, and (3) a treatment strategy without 
      digital tooth movement. Sentences of (1) were vectorized according to the bag of 
      words method (V); sentences of (2) and (3) were relabelled with 423 and 330 
      labels, respectively. AI systems that output labels for the prioritized list 
      (subtask 1) and treatment planning (subtask 2) based on the vectors V were 
      developed using a support vector machine and self-attention network, 
      respectively, while the system was trained to improve precision and recall. 
      Clinical evaluations were conducted by four orthodontists (no faculty or 
      residents; peer group) in two sessions: in the first session, peer group and the 
      developed AI systems created problem lists and treatment plans; in the second 
      session, two of the peer group (not AI) evaluated these lists and plans, 
      including the lists and plans of the AIs, by scoring them using 4-point scales 
      [unacceptable (1) to ideal (4)]. Scores were compared among the system and peer 
      group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: The precision after 
      system training was 65% and 48% for subtasks 1 and 2 respectively, with recall of 
      55% and 48%, respectively. The clinical evaluation of the AI system for subtask 1 
      showed a mid-rank. For subtask 2, the AI system had a significantly lower score 
      than the three panels but the same rank with one panel. CONCLUSIONS: Two AI 
      systems that output a prioritized problem list and create a treatment plan were 
      developed. The clinical system ability of the former system showed a mid-rank in 
      the peer group, and the latter system was almost equivalent to the worst 
      orthodontist.

TI  - AI-Assisted Treatment Planning for Dental Implant Placement: Clinical vs 
      AI-Generated Plans.
PG  - S939-S941
LID - 10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_1121_23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implant placement is a critical procedure in modern dentistry, 
      requiring precise treatment planning to ensure successful outcomes. 
      Traditionally, treatment planning has relied on the expertise of clinicians, but 
      recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up the 
      possibility of AI-assisted treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 
      patients requiring dental implant placement were included in this comparative 
      study. For each patient, a clinical treatment plan was created by an experienced 
      dentist, while an AI algorithm, trained on a dataset of implant placement cases, 
      generated an alternative plan. Various parameters, including implant position, 
      angulation, and depth, were compared between the two plans. Surgical templates 
      were fabricated based on both plans to guide implant placement accurately. 
      RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that AI-generated treatment plans 
      closely align with clinical plans in terms of implant positioning, angulation, 
      and depth. Mean discrepancies of less than 1 mm and 2 degrees were observed for 
      implant position and angulation, respectively, between the two planning methods. 
      The AI-generated plans also showed a reduction in planning time, averaging 10 min 
      compared to the clinical planning, which averaged 30 min per case. Additionally, 
      the surgical templates based on AI-generated plans exhibited similar accuracy in 
      implant placement as those based on clinical plans. CONCLUSION: AI-assisted 
      treatment planning for dental implant placement demonstrates promising results in 
      terms of accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude and Perception Regarding Artificial Intelligence in 
      Periodontology: A Questionnaire Study.
PG  - e48309
LID - 10.7759/cureus.48309 [doi]
LID - e48309
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
      learning (ML) models has brought about a significant transformation in the manner 
      in which periodontists gather information, evaluate associated risks, develop 
      diverse treatment alternatives, anticipate and diagnose dental conditions that 
      compromise periodontal health. The principal objective of this prospective study 
      was to examine periodontists' understanding and acceptance of the application of 
      AI in the realm of periodontology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational 
      study was conducted on 275 participants based on questionnaire using Google 
      Forms. These forms were pre-validated and subsequently circulated among 
      periodontists in Maharashtra via various social media platforms. The study, in 
      its entirety, comprised four open-ended questions on participants' demographics 
      and 14 closed-ended questions, all of which were presented to the participants in 
      English. These questions aimed to elicit participants' awareness, knowledge, 
      attitudes, and perspectives regarding emerging applications of AI in the field of 
      periodontology. To analyze the collected data, researchers employed the widely 
      utilized Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULT: A 
      75% response rate was achieved and 68% of the respondents were female. 62% 
      periodontists were aware of AI; however, only 24% were aware of its working 
      principles. Most respondents agreed with the use of AI in periodontal diagnosis; 
      however, they disagreed with the use of AI in predicting clinical attachment loss 
      (69%). 80-82% respondents felt that AI should be a part of postgraduate training 
      and should be implemented in clinical practice. However, most periodontists do 
      not use AI for diagnostic or research purposes. 49% periodontists felt that AI 
      does not have better diagnostic accuracy than periodontists, and therefore cannot 
      replace them in the future. CONCLUSION: Most periodontists possessed a reasonable 
      level of understanding regarding the utilization of AI in the domain of 
      periodontology and expressed a desire to incorporate it into their diagnostic and 
      treatment planning processes for periodontal conditions. Additional endeavors 
      must be undertaken to enhance periodontists' awareness concerning the effective 
      implementation of AI within their professional practice, with the aim of 
      facilitating personalized treatment planning for their respective patients. It is 
      postulated that the integration of AI will augment the likelihood of achieving 
      favorable outcomes within the realm of periodontology.

TI  - Deep learning method for reducing metal artifacts in dental cone-beam CT using 
      supplementary information from intra-oral scan.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ac8852 [doi]
AB  - Objective.Recently, dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) methods have been 
      improved to significantly reduce radiation dose while maintaining image 
      resolution with minimal equipment cost. In low-dose CBCT environments, metallic 
      inserts such as implants, crowns, and dental fillings cause severe artifacts, 
      which result in a significant loss of morphological structures of teeth in 
      reconstructed images. Such metal artifacts prevent accurate 3D bone-teeth-jaw 
      modeling for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the performance of 
      existing metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods in handling the loss of the 
      morphological structures of teeth in reconstructed CT images remains relatively 
      limited. In this study, we developed an innovative MAR method to achieve optimal 
      restoration of anatomical details.Approach.The proposed MAR approach is based on 
      a two-stage deep learning-based method. In the first stage, we employ a deep 
      learning network that utilizes intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and performs 
      multi-task learning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. The network is designed to 
      improve the learning ability of capturing teeth-related features effectively 
      while mitigating metal artifacts. In the second stage, a 3D bone-teeth-jaw model 
      is constructed with weighted thresholding, where the weighting region is 
      determined depending on the geometry of the intra-oral scan data.Main results.The 
      results of numerical simulations and clinical experiments are presented to 
      demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.Significance.We propose for 
      the first time a MAR method using radiation-free intra-oral scan data as 
      supplemental information on the tooth morphological structures of teeth, which is 
      designed to perform accurate 3D bone-teeth-jaw modeling in low-dose CBCT 
      environments.

LID - 10.1159/000530563 [doi]
AB  - Caries risk assessment (CRA) is essential to delivering personalized/precision 
      care in caries management. Limited formal evaluation and validation of existing 
      CRA tools affects the ability to accurately predict new lesions. However, this 
      should not prevent clinicians from assessing modifiable risk factors to guide 
      preventive measures and address individual needs to personalize care. Since 
      caries is a multifactorial and dynamic disease process, CRA is complex and 
      impacted by multiple variables throughout the life course, demanding periodic 
      re-assessment. Many factors can influence caries risk at the individual, family, 
      and community level; however, unfortunately, caries experience is still 
      considered one of the greatest indicators of future risk for caries. CRA tools 
      that are validated, inexpensive, and easy to use should be developed and 
      prioritized to help support decision-making to implement evidence based, and 
      minimally invasive caries management strategies for coronal caries lesions in 
      children, adults, and older persons. Efforts into developing CRA tools should 
      include evaluation and reporting of internal and external validation information. 
      In the future, approaches using big data and artificial intelligence may drive 
      risk predictions, and cost-effectiveness analyses may help derive the selection 
      of appropriate risk thresholds for decision-making. Because of the importance of 
      CRA in the treatment planning and decision-making process, challenges for 
      implementation including how to communicate risk to drive behavior change, 
      development of tools that are quick and easy to integrate seamlessly into the 
      busy clinical flow, and reimbursement for the time needed to implement should be 
      considered.

      REGIMEN FOR CONCOMITANT PATHOLO-GIES].
PG  - 79-83
AB  - In everyday practice orthodontists treat a lot of patients with different general 
      diseases or taking some medications and nutritional supplements. Many 
      farmacological agents and pathological conditions could influence bone metabolism 
      and deteriorate the results of orthodontic therapy. Aim of the study was to 
      analyze how many orthodontic patients have general diseases of taking any 
      medications on regular basis. To work out diagnostic and treatment algorithms, 
      based on general health status of the patient. 273 questionaries of orthodontic 
      patients, treated by the same doctor in private clinic were analyzed. 97 patients 
      (age 3,5-18 years) and 176 patients (age 19-64). 39,9% of patients have one or 
      more chronic diseases (allergy, hypofunction of thyroid gland, artritis, 
      hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes II type). 60,4% of patients take on regular 
      basis estrogen-containing medications, L-thyroxine, glucocorticoid therapy, NSAI 
      medications, vitamin D₃, Omega-3 and other nutritional supplements. Knowledge of 
      clinical signs of the general disease, understanding of pathological process and 
      it possible influence on the physiology of orthodontic tooth movement are of 
      paramound importance for the orthodontist to work out correct treatment plan, 
      choose type of appliance, schedule of activation and retention protocol.

TI  - Applications of Machine Learning in Facial Cosmetic Surgeries: A Scoping Review.
PG  - 1377-1393
LID - 10.1007/s00266-023-03379-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the application of machine learning (ML) in the facial 
      cosmetic surgeries and procedures METHODS AND MATERIALS: Electronic search was 
      conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, ArXiv and Cochrane databases 
      for the studies published until August 2022. Studies that reported the 
      application of ML in various fields of facial cosmetic surgeries were included. 
      The studies' risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool and NIH tool 
      for before and after studies. RESULTS: From 848 studies, a total of 29 studies 
      were included and categorized in five groups based on the aim of the studies: 
      outcome evaluation (n = 8), face recognition (n = 7), outcome prediction (n = 7), 
      patient concern evaluation (n = 4) and diagnosis (n = 3). Total of 16 studies 
      used public data sets. ROB assessment using QUADAS-2 tool revealed that six 
      studies were at low ROB, five studies were at high ROB, and others had moderate 
      ROB. All studies assessed with NIH tool showed fair quality. In general, all 
      studies showed that using ML in the facial cosmetic surgeries is accurate enough 
      to benefit both surgeons and patients. CONCLUSION: Using ML in the field of 
      facial cosmetic surgery is a novel method and needs further studies, especially 
      in the fields of diagnosis and treatment planning. Due to the small number of 
      articles and the qualitative analysis conducted, we cannot draw a general 
      conclusion about the impact of ML in the sphere of facial cosmetic surgery. LEVEL 
      OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to 
      each article. For a full description of these Evidence-Based Medicine ratings,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since AI algorithms can analyze patient data, medical records, and 
      imaging results to suggest treatment plans and predict outcomes, they have the 
      potential to support pathologists and clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment 
      of oral and maxillofacial pathologies, just like every other area of life in 
      which it is being used. The goal of the current study was to examine all of the 
      trends being investigated in the area of oral and maxillofacial pathology where 
      AI has been possibly involved in helping practitioners. METHODS: We started by 
      defining the important terms in our investigation's subject matter. Following 
      that, relevant databases like PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched 
      using keywords and synonyms for each concept, such as "machine learning," 
      "diagnosis," "treatment planning," "image analysis," "predictive modelling," and 
      "patient monitoring." For more papers and sources, Google Scholar was also used. 
      RESULTS: The majority of the 9 studies that were chosen were on how AI can be 
      utilized to diagnose malignant tumors of the oral cavity. AI was especially 
      helpful in creating prediction models that aided pathologists and clinicians in 
      foreseeing the development of oral and maxillofacial pathology in specific 
      patients. Additionally, predictive models accurately identified patients who have 
      a high risk of developing oral cancer as well as the likelihood of the disease 
      returning after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of oral and maxillofacial 
      pathology, AI has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision, personalize 
      care, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The development and application of 
      AI in healthcare, however, necessitates careful consideration of ethical, legal, 
      and regulatory challenges. Additionally, because AI is still a relatively new 
      technology, caution must be taken when applying it to this industry.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Upper airway assessment requires a fully-automated segmentation 
      system for complete or sub-regional identification. This study aimed to develop a 
      novel Deep Learning (DL) model for accurate segmentation of the upper airway and 
      achieve entire and subregional identification. METHODS: Fifty cone-beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) scans, including 24,502 slices, were labelled as the ground 
      truth by one orthodontist and two otorhinolaryngologists. A novel model, a 
      lightweight multitask network based on the Swin Transformer and U-Net, was built 
      for automatic segmentation of the entire upper airway and subregions. 
      Segmentation performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall, Dice similarity 
      coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over union (IoU). The clinical implications of 
      the precision errors were quantitatively analysed, and comparisons between the AI 
      model and Dolphin software were conducted. RESULTS: Our model achieved good 
      performance with a precision of 85.88-94.25%, recall of 93.74-98.44%, DSC of 
      90.95-96.29%, IoU of 83.68-92.85% in the overall and subregions of 
      three-dimensional (3D) upper airway, and a precision of 91.22-97.51%, recall of 
      90.70-97.62%, DSC of 90.92-97.55%, and IoU of 83.41-95.29% in the subregions of 
      two-dimensional (2D) crosssections. Discrepancies in volume and area caused by 
      precision errors did not affect clinical outcomes. Both our AI model and the 
      Dolphin software provided clinically acceptable consistency for pharyngeal airway 
      assessments. CONCLUSION: The novel DL model not only achieved segmentation of the 
      entire upper airway, including the nasal cavity and subregion identification, but 
      also performed exceptionally well, making it well suited for 3D upper airway 
      assessment from the nasal cavity to the hypopharynx, especially for intricate 
      structures. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This system provides insights into the 
      aetiology, risk, severity, treatment effect, and prognosis of dentoskeletal 
      deformities and obstructive sleep apnea. It achieves rapid assessment of the 
      entire upper airway and its subregions, making airway management-an integral part 
      of orthodontic treatment, orthognathic surgery, and ENT surgery-easier.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of deep learning 
      algorithms to diagnose tooth caries and classify the extension and location of 
      dental caries in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the application of deep learning 
      for dental caries in CBCT images. METHODS: The CBCT image dataset comprised 382 
      molar teeth with caries and 403 noncarious molar cases. The dataset was divided 
      into a development set for training and validation and test set. Three images 
      were obtained for each case, including axial, sagittal, and coronal. The test 
      dataset was provided to a multiple-input convolutional neural network (CNN). The 
      network made predictions regarding the presence or absence of dental decay and 
      classified the lesions according to their depths and types for the provided 
      samples. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score values were measured 
      for dental caries detection and classification. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy, 
      sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score for caries detection in carious molar 
      teeth were 95.3%, 92.1%, 96.3%, and 93.2%, respectively, and for noncarious molar 
      teeth were 94.8%, 94.3%, 95.8%, and 94.6%. The CNN network showed high 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in classifying caries extensions and 
      locations. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates that deep learning models can 
      accurately identify dental caries and classify their depths and types with high 
      accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The successful application of deep 
      learning in this field will undoubtedly assist dental practitioners and patients 
      in improving diagnostic and treatment planning in dentistry. CLINICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed that deep learning can accurately detect and 
      classify dental caries. Deep learning can provide dental caries detection 
      accurately. Considering the shortage of dentists in certain areas, using CNNs can 
      lead to broader geographic coverage in detecting dental caries.

AB  - T-cell immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies have become 
      standard-of-care treatments for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There is a need to 
      develop robust biomarkers that predict patient outcomes to targeted therapies to 
      personalise treatment. In recent years, quantitative analysis of imaging 
      features, termed radiomics, has been used to extract tumour features. This 
      narrative mini review summarises the evidence for radiomics prediction of 
      immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy outcomes in RCC. Radiomics may 
      predict survival, treatment response, and disease progression in RCC treated with 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, sunitinib) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, 
      nivolumab). Further validation is necessary in large-scale studies. PATIENT 
      SUMMARY: We summarise evidence on the ability of features extracted from CT 
      (computed tomography) scans to predict patient outcomes from new treatments for 
      kidney cancer. Although these features can predict treatment outcomes for 
      patients, including survival, treatment response, and cancer progression, further 
      research is necessary before this technology can be applied clinically.

TI  - With or without human interference for precise age estimation based on machine 
      learning?
PG  - 821-831

AB  - Age estimation can aid in forensic medicine applications, diagnosis, and 
      treatment planning for orthodontics and pediatrics. Existing dental age 
      estimation methods rely heavily on specialized knowledge and are highly 
      subjective, wasting time, and energy, which can be perfectly solved by machine 
      learning techniques. As the key factor affecting the performance of machine 
      learning models, there are usually two methods for feature extraction: human 
      interference and autonomous extraction without human interference. However, 
      previous studies have rarely applied these two methods for feature extraction in 
      the same image analysis task. Herein, we present two types of convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs) for dental age estimation. One is an automated dental 
      stage evaluation model (ADSE model) based on specified manually defined features, 
      and the other is an automated end-to-end dental age estimation model (ADAE 
      model), which autonomously extracts potential features for dental age estimation. 
      Although the mean absolute error (MAE) of the ADSE model for stage classification 
      is 0.17 stages, its accuracy in dental age estimation is unsatisfactory, with the 
      MAE (1.63 years) being only 0.04 years lower than the manual dental age 
      estimation method (MDAE model). However, the MAE of the ADAE model is 0.83 years, 
      being reduced by half that of the MDAE model. The results show that fully 
      automated feature extraction in a deep learning model without human interference 
      performs better in dental age estimation, prominently increasing the accuracy and 
      objectivity. This indicates that without human interference, machine learning may 
      perform better in the application of medical imaging.

AB  - The detection of maxillary sinus wall is important in dental fields such as 
      implant surgery, tooth extraction, and odontogenic disease diagnosis. The 
      accurate segmentation of the maxillary sinus is required as a cornerstone for 
      diagnosis and treatment planning. This study proposes a deep learning-based 
      method for fully automatic segmentation of the maxillary sinus, including clear 
      or hazy states, on cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images. A model for 
      segmentation of the maxillary sinuses was developed using U-Net, a convolutional 
      neural network, and a total of 19,350 CBCT images were used from 90 maxillary 
      sinuses (34 clear sinuses, 56 hazy sinuses). Post-processing to eliminate 
      prediction errors of the U-Net segmentation results increased the accuracy. The 
      average prediction results of U-Net were a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 
      0.9090 ± 0.1921 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.7013 ± 4.6154. After 
      post-processing, the average results improved to a DSC of 0.9099 ± 0.1914 and an 
      HD of 2.1470 ± 2.2790. The proposed deep learning model with post-processing 
      showed good performance for clear and hazy maxillary sinus segmentation. This 
      model has the potential to help dental clinicians with maxillary sinus 
      segmentation, yielding equivalent accuracy in a variety of cases.

TI  - Machine learning based orthodontic treatment planning for mixed dentition 
      borderline cases suffering from moderate to severe crowding: An experimental 
      research study.
PG  - 1723-1735
LID - 10.3233/THC-220563 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pedodontists and general practitioners may need support in planning 
      the early orthodontic treatment of patients with mixed dentition, especially in 
      borderline cases. The use of machine learning algorithms is required to be able 
      to consistently make treatment decisions for such cases. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to use machine learning algorithms to facilitate the process of deciding 
      whether to choose serial extraction or expansion of maxillary and mandibular 
      dental arches for early treatment of borderline patients suffering from moderate 
      to severe crowding. METHODS: The dataset of 116 patients who were previously 
      treated by senior orthodontists and divided into two groups according to their 
      treatment modalities were examined. Machine Learning algorithms including 
      Multilayer Perceptron, Linear Logistic Regression, k-nearest Neighbors, Naïve 
      Bayes, and Random Forest were trained on this dataset. Several metrics were used 
      for the evaluation of accuracy, precision, recall, and kappa statistic. RESULTS: 
      The most important 12 features were determined with the feature selection 
      algorithm. While all algorithms achieved over 90% accuracy, Random Forest yielded 
      95% accuracy, with high reliability values (kappa = 0.90). CONCLUSION: The 
      employment of machine learning methods for the treatment decision with or without 
      extraction in the early treatment of patients in the mixed dentition can be 
      particularly useful for pedodontists and general practitioners.

TI  - Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Senior Residents in Oral Lesion Diagnosis: 
      A Comparative Study.
PG  - e51584
LID - 10.7759/cureus.51584 [doi]
LID - e51584
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that 
      seeks to build intelligent machines that can carry out tasks that usually 
      necessitate human intelligence. AI may help dentists with a variety of dental 
      tasks, including clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. This study aims to 
      compare the performance of AI and oral medicine residents in diagnosing different 
      cases, providing treatment, and determining if it is reliable to assist them in 
      their field of work. METHODS: The study conducted a comparative analysis of the 
      responses from third- and fourth-year residents trained in Oral Medicine and 
      Pathology at King Saud University, College of Dentistry. The residents were given 
      a closed multiple-choice test consisting of 19 questions with four response 
      options labeled A-D and one question with five response options labeled A-E. The 
      test was administered via Google Forms, and each resident's response was stored 
      electronically in an Excel sheet (Microsoft® Corp., Redmond, WA). The residents' 
      answers were then compared to the responses generated by three major language 
      models: OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI. The questions were inputted into the 
      language models in the same format as the original test, and prior to each 
      question, an artificial intelligence chat session was created to eliminate memory 
      retention bias. The input was done on November 19, 2023, the same day the 
      official multiple-choice test was administered. The study had a sample size of 20 
      residents trained in Oral Medicine and Pathology at King Saud University, College 
      of Dentistry, consisting of both third-year and fourth-year residents. RESULT: 
      The responses of three large language models (LLM), including OpenAI, 
      Stablediffusion, and PopAI, as well as the responses of 20 senior residents for 
      20 clinical cases about oral lesion diagnosis. There were no significant 
      variations observed for the remaining questions in the responses to only two 
      questions (10%). For the remaining questions, there were no significant 
      differences. The median (IQR) score of LLMs was 50.0 (45.0 to 60.0), with a 
      minimum of 40 (for stable diffusion) and a maximum of 70 (for OpenAI). The median 
      (IQR) score of senior residents was 65.0 (55.0-75.0). The highest and lowest 
      scores of residents were 40 and 90, respectively. There was no significant 
      difference in the percent scores of residents and LLMs (p = 0.211). The agreement 
      level was measured using the Kappa value. The agreement among senior dental 
      residents was observed to be weak, with a Kappa value of 0.396. In contrast, the 
      agreement among LLMs demonstrated a moderate level, with a Kappa value of 0.622, 
      suggesting a more cohesive alignment in responses among the artificial 
      intelligence models. When comparing residents' responses with those generated by 
      different OpenAI models, including OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI, the 
      agreement levels were consistently categorized as weak, with Kappa values of 
      0.402, 0.381, and 0.392, respectively. CONCLUSION: What the current study reveals 
      is that when comparing the response score, there is no significant difference, in 
      contrast to the agreement analysis among the residents, which was low compared to 
      the LLMs, in which it was high. Dentists should consider that AI is very 
      beneficial in providing diagnosis and treatment and use it to assist them.

LID - e51258
AB  - This comprehensive review delves into the intricate landscape of cast post 
      retention in restorative dentistry, encompassing historical perspectives, 
      contemporary techniques, and future directions. Examining factors ranging from 
      tooth-related considerations to prosthesis-related dynamics, the review provides 
      a detailed analysis of clinical techniques, including step-by-step procedures, 
      common challenges, and innovative advancements. Technological breakthroughs, such 
      as digital impressions, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing 
      (CAD/CAM) technology, three-dimensional (3D) printing, and finite element 
      analysis, are explored for their transformative impact on precision and 
      customization. The discussion extends to the promising future of cast post 
      retention, emphasising emerging materials, the integration of artificial 
      intelligence in treatment planning, and patient-specific approaches. Implications 
      for clinical practice underscore the importance of individualised treatment 
      planning and the adoption of advanced technologies. Recommendations for future 
      research advocate for comprehensive long-term clinical studies, investigations 
      into AI-driven treatment planning, and a focus on patient outcomes and 
      satisfaction. This review consolidates existing knowledge and anticipates a 
      future marked by enhanced precision, individualised care, and improved long-term 
      success in cast post-retained restorations.

LID - 1144159
AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe and disabling facial pain condition and is 
      characterized by intermittent, severe, electric shock-like pain in one (or more) 
      trigeminal subdivisions. This pain can be triggered by an innocuous stimulus or 
      can be spontaneous. Presently available therapies for TN include both surgical 
      and pharmacological management; however, the lack of a known etiology for TN 
      contributes to the unpredictable response to treatment and the variability in 
      long-term clinical outcomes. Given this, a range of peripheral and central 
      mechanisms underlying TN pain remain to be understood. We acquired functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from TN patients who (1) rested 
      comfortably in the scanner during a resting state session and (2) rated their 
      pain levels in real time using a calibrated tracking ball-controlled scale in a 
      pain tracking session. Following data acquisition, the data was analyzed using 
      the conventional correlation analysis and two artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-inspired deep learning methods: convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph 
      convolutional neural network (GCNN). Each of the three methods yielded a set of 
      brain regions related to the generation and perception of pain in TN. There were 
      6 regions that were identified by all three methods, including the superior 
      temporal cortex, the insula, the fusiform, the precentral gyrus, the superior 
      frontal gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus. Additionally, 17 regions, including 
      dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the thalamus, were identified by at 
      least two of the three methods. Collectively, these 23 regions are taken to 
      represent signature centers of TN pain and provide target areas for future 
      studies seeking to understand the central mechanisms of TN.

TI  - Asthma onset pattern and patient outcomes in a chronic rhinosinusitis population.
PG  - 495-503
LID - 10.1002/alr.22064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is strongly associated with comorbid 
      asthma. This study compares early-onset and late-onset asthma in a CRS population 
      using patient-reported and clinical characteristics. METHODS: At enrollment into 
      a clinical registry, CRS patients completed the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 
      (SNOT-22), Asthma Control Test (ACT), mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire 
      (miniAQLQ), the 29-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
      (PROMIS-29), and medication use questionnaires. Patients also reported comorbid 
      asthma and age at first asthma diagnosis. Early-onset (<18 years) and late-onset 
      (>18 years) asthma groups were defined. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, 
      and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare patient responses. RESULTS: A total 
      of 199 non-asthmatic (56.1%), 71 early-onset asthmatic (20.0%), and 85 late-onset 
      asthmatic (23.9%) CRS patients completed the survey. Body mass index (BMI) was 
      significantly higher in late-onset asthmatic (p = 0.046) while age, gender, race, 
      and smoking history did not differ with time of asthma onset. SNOT-22, ACT, and 
      miniAQLQ were not different between asthma groups, but late-onset asthmatics had 
      significantly lower physical function than non-asthmatics (p = 0.008). Compared 
      to non-asthmatics, late-onset asthmatics showed increased rates of nasal polyps 
      (p < 0.001), higher Lund-Mackay scores (p = 0.005), and had received more oral 
      steroid courses (p < 0.001) and endoscopic surgeries (p = 0.008) for CRS 
      management. Late-onset asthmatics compared to early-onset asthmatics showed 
      increased nasal polyposis (p = 0.011) and oral steroid courses for CRS (p = 
      0.003). CONCLUSION: While CRS-specific and asthma-specific patient-reported 
      outcome measures (PROMs) were not significantly different among groups, CRS 
      patients with late-onset asthma had poorer physical function, more frequent nasal 
      polyposis, and required increased treatment for CRS. Late-onset asthma may 
      predict more severe disease in CRS.

TI  - Performance of a Convolutional Neural Network- Based Artificial Intelligence 
      Algorithm for Automatic Cephalometric Landmark Detection.
PG  - 94-100
LID - 10.5152/TurkJOrthod.2022.22026 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an artificial intelligence model 
      to detect cephalometric landmark automatically en- abling the automatic analysis 
      of cephalometric radiographs which have a very important place in dental practice 
      and is used routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of dental and skeletal 
      disorders. METHODS: In this study, 1620 lateral cephalograms were obtained and 21 
      landmarks were included. The coordinates of all landmarks in the 1620 films were 
      obtained to establish a labeled data set: 1360 were used as a training set, 140 
      as a validation set, and 180 as a testing set. A convolutional neural 
      network-based artificial intelligence algorithm for automatic cephalometric 
      landmark detection was developed. Mean radial error and success detection rate 
      within the range of 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm were used to eval- uate the 
      performance of the model. RESULTS: Presented artificial intelligence system 
      (CranioCatch, Eskişehir, Turkey) could detect 21 anatomic landmarks in a lateral 
      ceph- alometric radiograph. The highest success detection rate scores of 2 mm, 
      2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm were obtained from the sella point as 98.3, 99.4, 99.4, 
      and 99.4, respectively. The mean radial error ± standard deviation value of the 
      sella point was found as 0.616 ± 0.43. The lowest success detection rate scores 
      of 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm were obtained from the Gonion point as 48.3, 
      62.8, 73.9, and 87.2, respectively. The mean radial error ± standard deviation 
      value of Gonion point was found as 8.304 ± 2.98. CONCLUSION: Although the success 
      of the automatic landmark detection using the developed artificial intelligence 
      model was not in- sufficient for clinical use, artificial intelligence-based 
      cephalometric analysis systems seem promising to cephalometric analysis which 
      provides a basis for diagnosis, treatment planning, and following-up in clinical 
      orthodontics practice.

TI  - Determinants of Clinical Decision Making under Uncertainty in Dentistry: A 
      Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13061076 [doi]
LID - 1076
AB  - Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases 
      consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical 
      judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision 
      making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at 
      systematically evaluating dental practitioners' clinical decision-making 
      processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping 
      review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and 
      complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the 
      articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine 
      (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with 
      PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were 
      included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 
      27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 
      1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were 
      experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical 
      factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and 
      biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These 
      results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real 
      possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based 
      practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical 
      decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly 
      those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to 
      sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach to Uncovering Hidden Utilization Patterns of Early 
      Childhood Dental Care Among Medicaid-Insured Children.

AB  - Background: Early childhood dental care (ECDC) is a significant public health 
      opportunity since dental caries is largely preventable and a prime target for 
      reducing healthcare expenditures. This study aims to discover underlying patterns 
      in ECDC utilization among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, which have significant 
      implications for public health prevention, innovative service delivery models, 
      and targeted cost-saving interventions. Methods: Using 9 years of longitudinal 
      Medicaid data of 24,223 publicly insured child members of an accountable care 
      organization (ACO), Partners for Kids in Ohio, we applied unsupervised machine 
      learning to cluster patients based on their cumulative dental cost curves in 
      early childhood (24-60 months). Clinical validity, analytical validity, and 
      reproducibility were assessed. Results: The clustering revealed five novel 
      subpopulations: (1) early-onset of decay by age (0.5% of the population, as early 
      as 28 months), (2) middle-onset of decay (3.0%, as early as 35 months), (3) 
      late-onset of decay (5.8%, as early as 44 months), (4) regular preventive care 
      (67.7%), and (5) zero utilization (23.0%). Patients with early-onset of decay 
      incurred the highest dental cost [median annual cost (MAC) = $9,499, 
      InterQuartile Range (IQR): $7,052-$11,216], while patients with regular 
      preventive care incurred the lowest dental cost (MAC = $191, IQR: $99-$336). We 
      also found a plausible correlation of early-onset of decay with complex medical 
      conditions diagnosed at 0-24 months. Almost one-third of patients with 
      early-onset of decay had complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0-24 months. 
      Patients with early-onset of decay also incurred the highest medical cost (MAC = 
      $7,513, IQR: $4,527-$12,546) at 0-24 months. Conclusion: Among Ohio 
      Medicaid-insured children, five subpopulations with distinctive clinical, cost, 
      and utilization patterns were discovered and validated through a data-driven 
      approach. This novel discovery promotes innovative prevention strategies that 
      differentiate Medicaid subpopulations, and allows for the development of 
      cost-effective interventions that target high-risk patients. Furthermore, an 
      integrated medical-dental care delivery model promises to reduce costs further 
      while improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Automatic Classification System for Periapical Lesions in Cone-Beam Computed 
      Tomography.
LID - 10.3390/s22176481 [doi]
LID - 6481
AB  - Imaging examinations are of remarkable importance for diagnostic support in 
      Dentistry. Imaging techniques allow analysis of dental and maxillofacial tissues 
      (e.g., bone, dentine, and enamel) that are inaccessible through clinical 
      examination, which aids in the diagnosis of diseases as well as treatment 
      planning. The analysis of imaging exams is not trivial; so, it is usually 
      performed by oral and maxillofacial radiologists. The increasing demand for 
      imaging examinations motivates the development of an automatic classification 
      system for diagnostic support, as proposed in this paper, in which we aim to 
      classify teeth as healthy or with endodontic lesion. The classification system 
      was developed based on a Siamese Network combined with the use of convolutional 
      neural networks with transfer learning for VGG-16 and DenseNet-121 networks. For 
      this purpose, a database with 1000 sagittal and coronal sections of cone-beam CT 
      scans was used. The results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, 
      and F1-score show that the proposed system has a satisfactory classification 
      performance. The innovative automatic classification system led to an accuracy of 
      about 70%. The work is pioneer since, to the authors knowledge, no other previous 
      work has used a Siamese Network for the purpose of classifying teeth as healthy 
      or with endodontic lesion, based on cone-beam computed tomography images.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis on the Impact of Various Aligner 
      Materials and Attachments on Orthodontic Tooth Movement.
LID - 10.3390/jfb14040209 [doi]
LID - 209
AB  - The majority of patients strongly favor the use of aligners in the present time, 
      especially with the advancement in esthetic dentistry. Today's market is flooded 
      with aligner companies, many of which share the same therapeutic ethos. We 
      therefore carried out a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate 
      research that had looked at various aligner materials and attachments and their 
      effect on orthodontic tooth movement in relevant studies. A total of 634 papers 
      were discovered after a thorough search of online journals using keywords such as 
      "Aligners", "Orthodontics", "Orthodontic attachments", "Orthodontic tooth 
      movement", and "Polyethylene" across databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, 
      and Cochrane. The authors individually and in parallel carried out the database 
      investigation, removal of duplicate studies, data extraction, and bias risk. The 
      statistical analysis demonstrated that the type of aligner material had a 
      significant impact on orthodontic tooth movement. The low level of heterogeneity 
      and significant overall effect further support this finding. However, there was 
      little effect of attachment size or shape on tooth mobility. The examined 
      materials were primarily concerned with influencing the physical/physicochemical 
      characteristics of the appliances and not tooth movement directly. Invisalign 
      (Inv) had a higher mean value than the other types of materials that were 
      analyzed, which suggested a potentially greater impact on orthodontic tooth 
      movement. However, its variance value indicated that there was also greater 
      uncertainty associated with the estimate compared to some of the other plastics. 
      These findings could have important implications for orthodontic treatment 
      planning and aligner material selection. Registration: This review protocol was 
      registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
      (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42022381466).

TI  - Artificial Intelligent Model With Neural Network Machine Learning for the 
      Diagnosis of Orthognathic Surgery.

AB  - Diagnosis and treatment planning are the most important steps in the orthognathic 
      surgery for the successful treatment. The purpose of this study was to develop a 
      new artificial intelligent model for surgery/non-surgery decision and extraction 
      determination, and to evaluate the performance of this model. The sample used in 
      this study consisted of 316 patients in total. Of the total sample, 160 were 
      planned with surgical treatment and 156 were planned with non-surgical treatment. 
      The input values of artificial neural network were obtained from 12 measurement 
      values of the lateral cephalogram and 6 additional indexes. The artificial 
      intelligent model of machine learning consisted of 2-layer neural network with 
      one hidden layer. The learning was carried out in 3 stages, and 4 best performing 
      models were adopted. Using these models, decision-making success rates of 
      surgery/non-surgery, surgery type, and extraction/non-extraction were calculated. 
      The final diagnosis success rate was calculated by comparing the actual diagnosis 
      with the diagnosis obtained by the artificial intelligent model. The success rate 
      of the model showed 96% for the diagnosis of surgery/non-surgery decision, and 
      showed 91% for the detailed diagnosis of surgery type and extraction decision. 
      This study suggests the artificial intelligent model using neural network machine 
      learning could be applied for the diagnosis of orthognathic surgery cases.

AB  - Intraoral scanners have been used to capture data for the design and subsequent 
      manufacture of dental restorations and also for registering color clinical 
      images. Scanners can capture datasets for future use and comparisons. This 
      manuscript describes the potential of using software algorithms to superimpose 3D 
      images captured at different times to calculate dimensional changes at the click 
      of a button in various dental fields. 3D patient monitoring, with the advance of 
      artificial intelligence and its built-in capacity for data analyses, will allow 
      dentists and researchers to calculate volumetric changes and predict potentially 
      adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  - From big data to better patient outcomes.
PG  - 580-586
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2022-1096 [doi]
AB  - Among medical specialties, laboratory medicine is the largest producer of 
      structured data and must play a crucial role for the efficient and safe 
      implementation of big data and artificial intelligence in healthcare. The area 
      of personalized therapies and precision medicine has now arrived, with huge data 
      sets not only used for experimental and research approaches, but also in the 
      "real world". Analysis of real world data requires development of legal, 
      procedural and technical infrastructure. The integration of all clinical data 
      sets for any given patient is important and necessary in order to develop a 
      patient-centered treatment approach. Data-driven research comes with its own 
      challenges and solutions. The Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and 
      Reusability (FAIR) Guiding Principles provide guidelines to make data findable, 
      accessible, interoperable and reusable to the research community. Federated 
      learning, standards and ontologies are useful to improve robustness of artificial 
      intelligence algorithms working on big data and to increase trust in these 
      algorithms. When dealing with big data, the univariate statistical approach 
      changes to multivariate statistical methods significantly shifting the potential 
      of big data. Combining multiple omics gives previously unsuspected information 
      and provides understanding of scientific questions, an approach which is also 
      called the systems biology approach. Big data and artificial intelligence also 
      offer opportunities for laboratories and the In Vitro Diagnostic industry to 
      optimize the productivity of the laboratory, the quality of laboratory results 
      and ultimately patient outcomes, through tools such as predictive maintenance and 
      "moving average" based on the aggregate of patient results.

TI  - Current Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Pediatric Dentistry: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - Purpose: To systematically evaluate artificial intelligence applications for 
      diagnostic and treatment planning possibilities in pediatric dentistry. Methods: 
      PubMed(®), EMBASE(®), Scopus, Web of Science(™), IEEE, medRxiv, arXiv, and Google 
      Scholar were searched using specific search queries. The Quality Assessment of 
      Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) checklist was used to assess the risk of 
      bias assessment of the included studies. Results: Based on the initial screening, 
      33 eligible studies were included (among 3,542). Eleven studies appeared to have 
      low bias risk across all QUADAS-2 domains. Most applications focused on early 
      childhood caries diagnosis and prediction, tooth identification, oral health 
      evaluation, and supernumerary tooth identification. Six studies evaluated AI 
      tools for mesiodens or supernumerary tooth identification on radigraphs, four for 
      primary tooth identification and/or numbering, seven studies to detect caries on 
      radiographs, and 12 to predict early childhood caries. For these four tasks, the 
      reported accuracy of AI varied from 60 percent to 99 percent, sensitivity was 
      from 20 percent to 100 percent, specificity was from 49 percent to 100 percent, 
      F1-score was from 60 percent to 97 percent, and the area-under-the-curve varied 
      from 87 percent to 100 percent. Conclusions: The overall body of evidence 
      regarding artificial intelligence applications in pediatric dentistry does not 
      allow for firm conclusions. For a wide range of applications, AI shows promising 
      accuracy. Future studies should focus on a comparison of AI against the standard 
      of care and employ a set of standardized outcomes and metrics to allow comparison 
      across studies.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation of Mandible from Conventional Methods to Deep Learning-A 
      Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11070629 [doi]
LID - 629
AB  - Medical imaging techniques, such as (cone beam) computed tomography and magnetic 
      resonance imaging, have proven to be a valuable component for oral and 
      maxillofacial surgery (OMFS). Accurate segmentation of the mandible from head and 
      neck (H&N) scans is an important step in order to build a personalized 3D digital 
      mandible model for 3D printing and treatment planning of OMFS. Segmented mandible 
      structures are used to effectively visualize the mandible volumes and to evaluate 
      particular mandible properties quantitatively. However, mandible segmentation is 
      always challenging for both clinicians and researchers, due to complex structures 
      and higher attenuation materials, such as teeth (filling) or metal implants that 
      easily lead to high noise and strong artifacts during scanning. Moreover, the 
      size and shape of the mandible vary to a large extent between individuals. 
      Therefore, mandible segmentation is a tedious and time-consuming task and 
      requires adequate training to be performed properly. With the advancement of 
      computer vision approaches, researchers have developed several algorithms to 
      automatically segment the mandible during the last two decades. The objective of 
      this review was to present the available fully (semi)automatic segmentation 
      methods of the mandible published in different scientific articles. This review 
      provides a vivid description of the scientific advancements to clinicians and 
      researchers in this field to help develop novel automatic methods for clinical 
      applications.

PG  - 376-384
LID - 10.1111/cid.13301 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the 
      automatic identification of the ridge deficiency around dental implants based on 
      an image slice from cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Single slices crossing the central long-axis of 630 mandibular and 845 
      maxillary virtually placed implants (4-5 mm diameter, 10 mm length) in 412 
      patients were used. The ridges were classified based on the intraoral 
      bone-implant support and sinus floor location. The slices were either 
      preprocessed by alveolar ridge homogenizing prior to DL (preprocessed) or left 
      unpreprocessed. A convolutional neural network with ResNet-50 architecture was 
      employed for DL. RESULTS: The model achieved an accuracy of >98.5% on the 
      unpreprocessed image slices and was found to be superior to the accuracy observed 
      on the preprocessed slices. On the mandible, model accuracy was 98.91 ± 1.45%, 
      and F1 score, a measure of a model's accuracy in binary classification tasks, was 
      lowest (97.30%) on the ridge with a combined horizontal-vertical defect. On the 
      maxilla, model accuracy was 98.82 ± 1.11%, and the ridge presenting an implant 
      collar-sinus floor distance of 5-10 mm with a dehiscence defect had the lowest F1 
      score (95.86%). To achieve >90% model accuracy, ≥441 mandibular slices or ≥592 
      maxillary slices were required. CONCLUSIONS: The ridge deficiency around dental 
      implants can be identified using DL from CBCT image slices without the need for 
      preprocessed homogenization. The model will be further strengthened by 
      implementing more clinical expertise in dental implant treatment planning and 
      incorporating multiple slices to classify 3-dimensional implant-ridge 
      relationships.

TI  - Evaluation of the Progression of Periodontitis with the Use of Neural Networks.
LID - 10.3390/jcm11164667 [doi]
LID - 4667
AB  - Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the tissues surrounding the tooth 
      that results in loss of periodontal attachment detected as clinical attachment 
      loss (CAL). The mildest form of periodontal disease is gingivitis, which is a 
      necessary condition for periodontitis development. We can distinguish also some 
      modifying factors which have an influence on the rate of development of 
      periodontitis from which the most important are smoking and poorly controlled 
      diabetes. According to the new classification from 2017, we can identify four 
      stages of periodontitis and three grades of periodontitis. Grades tell us about 
      the periodontitis progression risk and may be helpful in treatment planning and 
      motivating the patients. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used in 
      medicine and in dentistry as an additional tool to support clinicians in their 
      work. In this paper, ANN was used to assess grades of periodontitis in the group 
      of patients. Gender, age, nicotinism approximal plaque index (API), bleeding on 
      probing (BoP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and pocket depth (PD) were taken 
      into consideration. There were no statistically significant differences in the 
      clinical periodontal assessment in relation to the neural network assessment. 
      Based on the definition of the sensitivity and specificity in medicine we 
      obtained 85.7% and 80.0% as a correctly diagnosed and excluded disease, 
      respectively. The quality of the neural network, defined as the percentage of 
      correctly classified patients according to the grade of periodontitis was 84.2% 
      for the training set. The percentage of incorrectly classified patients according 
      to the grade of periodontitis was 15.8%. Artificial neural networks may be useful 
      tool in everyday dental practice to assess the risk of periodontitis development 
      however more studies are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore and discuss recent advancements in tooth 
      reconstruction utilizing deep learning (DL) techniques. A review on new DL 
      methodologies in partial and full tooth reconstruction is conducted. 
      DATA/SOURCES: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for 
      articles from 2003 to 2023. STUDY SELECTION: The review includes 9 articles 
      published from 2018 to 2023. The selected articles showcase novel DL approaches 
      for tooth reconstruction, while those concentrating solely on the application or 
      review of DL methods are excluded. The review shows that data is acquired via 
      intraoral scans or laboratory scans of dental plaster models. Common data 
      representations are depth maps, point clouds, and voxelized point clouds. 
      Reconstructions focus on single teeth, using data from adjacent teeth or the 
      entire jaw. Some articles include antagonist teeth data and features like 
      occlusal grooves and gap distance. Primary network architectures include 
      Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers. Compared to conventional 
      digital methods, DL-based tooth reconstruction reports error rates approximately 
      two times lower. CONCLUSIONS: Generative DL models analyze dental datasets to 
      reconstruct missing teeth by extracting insights into patterns and structures. 
      Through specialized application, these models reconstruct morphologically and 
      functionally sound dental structures, leveraging information from the existing 
      teeth. The reported advancements facilitate the feasibility of DL-based dental 
      crown reconstruction. Beyond GANs and Transformers with point clouds or voxels, 
      recent studies indicate promising outcomes with diffusion-based architectures and 
      innovative data representations like wavelets for 3D shape completion and 
      inference problems. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Generative network architectures 
      employed in the analysis and reconstruction of dental structures demonstrate 
      notable proficiency. The enhanced accuracy and efficiency of DL-based frameworks 
      hold the potential to enhance clinical outcomes and increase patient 
      satisfaction. The reduced reconstruction times and diminished requirement for 
      manual intervention may lead to cost savings and improved accessibility of dental 
      services.

TI  - Deep learning convolutional neural network algorithms for the early detection and 
      diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs: A systematic review.
PG  - 237-242
LID - 10.5624/isd.20210074 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyse and review deep learning 
      convolutional neural networks for detecting and diagnosing early-stage dental 
      caries on periapical radiographs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to conduct this 
      review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies published from 2015 to 2021 under the 
      keywords (deep convolutional neural network) AND (caries), (deep learning caries) 
      AND (convolutional neural network) AND (caries) were systematically reviewed. 
      RESULTS: When dental caries is improperly diagnosed, the lesion may eventually 
      invade the enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue, leading to loss of tooth function. 
      Rapid and precise detection and diagnosis are vital for implementing appropriate 
      prevention and treatment of dental caries. Radiography and intraoral images are 
      considered to play a vital role in detecting dental caries; nevertheless, studies 
      have shown that 20% of suspicious areas are mistakenly diagnosed as dental caries 
      using this technique; hence, diagnosis via radiography alone without an objective 
      assessment is inaccurate. Identifying caries with a deep convolutional neural 
      network-based detector enables the operator to distinguish changes in the 
      location and morphological features of dental caries lesions. Deep learning 
      algorithms have broader and more profound layers and are continually being 
      developed, remarkably enhancing their precision in detecting and segmenting 
      objects. CONCLUSION: Clinical applications of deep learning convolutional neural 
      networks in the dental field have shown significant accuracy in detecting and 
      diagnosing dental caries, and these models hold promise in supporting dental 
      practitioners to improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Current Considerations for Clinical Management and Care of People with HIV: 
      Findings from the 11th Annual International HIV and Aging Workshop.
PG  - 807-820
LID - 10.1089/AID.2021.0059 [doi]
AB  - The number of people with HIV (PWH) aged 50 years or older continues to steadily 
      increase. The convergence of age- and HIV-related complications in these 
      individuals presents a challenge for both patients and clinicians alike. New 
      findings continue to emerge, as numerous researchers evaluate the combined impact 
      of these two factors on quality of life, physiological systems, and mental health 
      in PWH. Since its first occurrence in 2009, the International Workshop on HIV and 
      Aging has served as a multidisciplinary meeting to share basic biomedical data, 
      clinical trial results, treatment strategies, and epidemiological 
      recommendations, toward better understanding and outcomes among like-minded 
      scientific professionals. In this article, we share a selection of key findings 
      presented in plenary talks at the 11th Annual International Workshop on HIV and 
      Aging, held virtually from September 30, 2020 to October 2, 2020. We will also 
      address the future directions of HIV and aging research, to further assess how 
      the aging process intersects with chronic HIV.

AB  - In recent times, dentistry has seen significant technological advancements that 
      have transformed various specialized areas within the field. Developed into 
      applications for mobile devices, augmented reality (AR) seamlessly merges digital 
      components with the physical world, enhancing both realms while maintaining their 
      individual separateness. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) relies on 
      advanced, tailored software to visualize a digital 3D environment stimulating the 
      operator's senses through computer generated sensations and feedback. The current 
      advances use the application of VR, haptic simulators, the use of an AI algorithm 
      and many more that provides new opportunities for smart learning and enhance the 
      teaching environment. As this technology continues to evolve, it is poised to 
      become even more remarkable, enabling specialists to potentially visualize both 
      soft and hard tissues within the patient's body for effective treatment planning. 
      This literature aims to present the newest advancements and ongoing development 
      of AR and VR in dentistry and medicine. It highlights their diverse applications 
      while identifying areas needing further research for effective integration into 
      clinical practice.

AB  - Recent advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have 
      profoundly impacted various fields, including diagnostic imaging. Integrating AI 
      technologies such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks has the 
      potential to drastically improve diagnostic methods in the field of dentistry and 
      maxillofacial radiography. A systematic study that adhered to Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards was carried out 
      to examine the efficacy and uses of AI in dentistry and maxillofacial 
      radiography. Incorporating cohort studies, case-control studies, and randomized 
      clinical trials, the study used an interdisciplinary methodology. A thorough 
      search spanning peer-reviewed research papers from 2009 to 2023 was done in 
      databases including MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE. The inclusion criteria were 
      original clinical research in English that employed AI models to recognize 
      anatomical components in oral and maxillofacial pictures, identify anomalies, and 
      diagnose disorders. The study looked at numerous research that used cutting-edge 
      technology to show how accurate and dependable dental imaging is. Among the tasks 
      covered by these investigations were age estimation, periapical lesion detection, 
      segmentation of maxillary structures, assessment of dentofacial abnormalities, 
      and segmentation of the mandibular canal. The study revealed important 
      developments in the precise definition of anatomical structures and the 
      identification of diseases. The use of AI technology in dental imaging marks a 
      revolutionary development that will usher in a time of unmatched accuracy and 
      effectiveness. These technologies have not only improved diagnostic accuracy and 
      enabled early disease detection but have also streamlined intricate procedures, 
      significantly enhancing patient outcomes. The symbiotic collaboration between 
      human expertise and machine intelligence promises a future of more sophisticated 
      and empathetic oral healthcare.

TI  - A digital score of peri-epithelial lymphocytic activity predicts malignant 
      transformation in oral epithelial dysplasia.
PG  - 431-442

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is amongst the most common cancers, with more 
      than 377,000 new cases worldwide each year. OSCC prognosis remains poor, related 
      to cancer presentation at a late stage, indicating the need for early detection 
      to improve patient prognosis. OSCC is often preceded by a premalignant state 
      known as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), which is diagnosed and graded using 
      subjective histological criteria leading to variability and prognostic 
      unreliability. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the 
      development of prognostic models for malignant transformation and their 
      association with clinical outcomes in histology whole slide images (WSIs) of OED 
      tissue sections. We train a weakly supervised method on OED cases (n = 137) with 
      malignant transformation (n = 50) and mean malignant transformation time of 
      6.51 years (±5.35 SD). Stratified five-fold cross-validation achieved an average 
      area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.78 for 
      predicting malignant transformation in OED. Hotspot analysis revealed various 
      features of nuclei in the epithelium and peri-epithelial tissue to be significant 
      prognostic factors for malignant transformation, including the count of 
      peri-epithelial lymphocytes (PELs) (p < 0.05), epithelial layer nuclei count (NC) 
      (p < 0.05), and basal layer NC (p < 0.05). Progression-free survival (PFS) using 
      the epithelial layer NC (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.73), basal layer NC (p < 0.05, 
      C-index = 0.70), and PELs count (p < 0.05, C-index = 0.73) all showed association 
      of these features with a high risk of malignant transformation in our univariate 
      analysis. Our work shows the application of deep learning for the prognostication 
      and prediction of PFS of OED for the first time and offers potential to aid 
      patient management. Further evaluation and testing on multi-centre data is 
      required for validation and translation to clinical practice. © 2023 The Authors.

TI  - The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Health Equity in Oncology: Scoping 
      Review.
PG  - e39748
LID - 10.2196/39748 [doi]
LID - e39748
AB  - BACKGROUND: The field of oncology is at the forefront of advances in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) in health care, providing an opportunity to examine the early 
      integration of these technologies in clinical research and patient care. Hope 
      that AI will revolutionize health care delivery and improve clinical outcomes has 
      been accompanied by concerns about the impact of these technologies on health 
      equity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a scoping review of the literature to 
      address the question, "What are the current and potential impacts of AI 
      technologies on health equity in oncology?" METHODS: Following PRISMA-ScR 
      (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
      Scoping Reviews) guidelines for scoping reviews, we systematically searched 
      MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases from January 2000 to August 2021 for 
      records engaging with key concepts of AI, health equity, and oncology. We 
      included all English-language articles that engaged with the 3 key concepts. 
      Articles were analyzed qualitatively for themes pertaining to the influence of AI 
      on health equity in oncology. RESULTS: Of the 14,011 records, 133 (0.95%) 
      identified from our review were included. We identified 3 general themes in the 
      literature: the use of AI to reduce health care disparities (58/133, 43.6%), 
      concerns surrounding AI technologies and bias (16/133, 12.1%), and the use of AI 
      to examine biological and social determinants of health (55/133, 41.4%). A total 
      of 3% (4/133) of articles focused on many of these themes. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      scoping review revealed 3 main themes on the impact of AI on health equity in 
      oncology, which relate to AI's ability to help address health disparities, its 
      potential to mitigate or exacerbate bias, and its capability to help elucidate 
      determinants of health. Gaps in the literature included a lack of discussion of 
      ethical challenges with the application of AI technologies in low- and 
      middle-income countries, lack of discussion of problems of bias in AI algorithms, 
      and a lack of justification for the use of AI technologies over traditional 
      statistical methods to address specific research questions in oncology. Our 
      review highlights a need to address these gaps to ensure a more equitable 
      integration of AI in cancer research and clinical practice. The limitations of 
      our study include its exploratory nature, its focus on oncology as opposed to all 
      health care sectors, and its analysis of solely English-language articles.

TI  - Accuracy of Artificial Intelligence Models in Dental Implant Fixture 
      Identification and Classification from Radiographs: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics14080806 [doi]
LID - 806
AB  - Background and Objectives: The availability of multiple dental implant systems 
      makes it difficult for the treating dentist to identify and classify the implant 
      in case of inaccessibility or loss of previous records. Artificial intelligence 
      (AI) is reported to have a high success rate in medical image classification and 
      is effectively used in this area. Studies have reported improved implant 
      classification and identification accuracy when AI is used with trained dental 
      professionals. This systematic review aims to analyze various studies discussing 
      the accuracy of AI tools in implant identification and classification. Methods: 
      The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines were followed, and the study was registered with the International 
      Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). The focused PICO question 
      for the current study was "What is the accuracy (outcome) of artificial 
      intelligence tools (Intervention) in detecting and/or classifying the type of 
      dental implant (Participant/population) using X-ray images?" Web of Science, 
      Scopus, MEDLINE-PubMed, and Cochrane were searched systematically to collect the 
      relevant published literature. The search strings were based on the formulated 
      PICO question. The article search was conducted in January 2024 using the Boolean 
      operators and truncation. The search was limited to articles published in English 
      in the last 15 years (January 2008 to December 2023). The quality of all the 
      selected articles was critically analyzed using the Quality Assessment and 
      Diagnostic Accuracy Tool (QUADAS-2). Results: Twenty-one articles were selected 
      for qualitative analysis based on predetermined selection criteria. Study 
      characteristics were tabulated in a self-designed table. Out of the 21 studies 
      evaluated, 14 were found to be at risk of bias, with high or unclear risk in one 
      or more domains. The remaining seven studies, however, had a low risk of bias. 
      The overall accuracy of AI models in implant detection and identification ranged 
      from a low of 67% to as high as 98.5%. Most included studies reported mean 
      accuracy levels above 90%. Conclusions: The articles in the present review 
      provide considerable evidence to validate that AI tools have high accuracy in 
      identifying and classifying dental implant systems using 2-dimensional X-ray 
      images. These outcomes are vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning by 
      trained dental professionals to enhance patient treatment outcomes.

      Hopkins formula or Sampson-NIH formula are more accurate when triglycerides are 
      elevated and/or LCL-C levels are low. In some instances, a direct LDL-C assay is 
      employed, particularly when the triglyceride levels are elevated (>400mg/dL). 
      Non-HDL-C can also be calculated (non-HDL-C = total cholesterol – HDL-C). 
      Increasing levels of LDL-C and non-HDL-C are associated with an increased risk of 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, numerous studies have 
      demonstrated that the association of non-HDL-C with ASCVD is more robust. It is 
      possible to measure apolipoprotein B and A-I levels, LDL and HDL size, LDL and 
      HDL particle number, and Lp(a). Numerous studies have documented a link between 
      small dense LDL particles and an increased risk of ASCVD; however, the 
      association is markedly reduced or entirely eliminated when the analyses are 
      adjusted for other factors that affect ASCVD risk. Similarly, there is little 
      data demonstrating that HDL subfractions are useful in risk prediction beyond HDL 
      and other traditional risk factors. Apolipoprotein B levels and LDL particle 
      number are more strongly associated with ASCVD than LDL-C, particularly when the 
      levels of LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels or LDL particle number are 
      discordant. Similarly, while apolipoprotein B levels or LDL particle number are 
      significantly better than non-HDL-C in predicting ASCVD risk when the levels of 
      non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels or LDL particle number are discordant 
      whether this will alter therapy in most patients is debated. The guidelines put 
      forth by a variety of different expert panels and organizations do not require 
      apolipoprotein B or LDL particle number but may use them as risk enhancing 
      factor. It is also the author’s opinion that at this time the routine measurement 
      of apolipoprotein B and/or LDL particle number is not required. Until data 
      demonstrate the superiority of measuring apolipoprotein B or LDL particle number 
      on clinical outcomes it is hard to recommend the routine use of such testing. 
      However, in situations where there is uncertainty measurement of apolipoprotein B 
      and/or LDL particle number can be helpful. Studies have demonstrated an 
      association of Lp(a) with ASCVD. Many experts recommend measuring Lp(a) once in 
      all patients while other experts recommend measuring Lp(a) more selectively in a) 
      patients with unexplained premature CHD, b) patients with a strong family history 
      of premature CHD, c) patients with resistance to LDL lowering with statins, d) 
      patients with rapid unexplained progression of atherosclerosis, and e) patients 
      with familial hypercholesterolemia. Elevations in Lp(a) will stimulate more 
      aggressive lowering of LDL and the consideration of adding drugs that lower Lp(a) 
      such as niacin or PCSK9 inhibitors. While routine use of advanced lipoprotein 
      testing is not routinely recommended it should be recognized that in selected 
      patients the additional information provided can be helpful and result in changes 
      in treatment. As additional drugs to treat lipids are developed and our 
      understanding of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism expands in the future the use 
      of advanced lipoprotein analysis may assume a more important role. For complete

TI  - Analysis of Clinical Phenotypes through Machine Learning of First-Line H. pylori 
      Treatment in Europe during the Period 2013-2022: Data from the European Registry 
      on H. pylori Management (Hp-EuReg).

AB  - The segmentation of patients into homogeneous groups could help to improve 
      eradication therapy effectiveness. Our aim was to determine the most important 
      treatment strategies used in Europe, to evaluate first-line treatment 
      effectiveness according to year and country. Data collection: All first-line 
      empirical treatments registered at AEGREDCap in the European Registry on 
      Helicobacter pylori management (Hp-EuReg) from June 2013 to November 2022. A 
      Boruta method determined the "most important" variables related to treatment 
      effectiveness. Data clustering was performed through multi-correspondence 
      analysis of the resulting six most important variables for every year in the 
      2013-2022 period. Based on 35,852 patients, the average overall treatment 
      effectiveness increased from 87% in 2013 to 93% in 2022. The lowest effectiveness 
      (80%) was obtained in 2016 in cluster #3 encompassing Slovenia, Lithuania, 
      Latvia, and Russia, treated with 7-day triple therapy with 
      amoxicillin-clarithromycin (92% of cases). The highest effectiveness (95%) was 
      achieved in 2022, mostly in Spain (81%), with the bismuth-quadruple therapy, 
      including the single-capsule (64%) and the concomitant treatment with 
      clarithromycin-amoxicillin-metronidazole/tinidazole (34%) with 10 (69%) and 14 
      (32%) days. Cluster analysis allowed for the identification of patients in 
      homogeneous treatment groups assessing the effectiveness of different first-line 
      treatments depending on therapy scheme, adherence, country, and prescription 
      year.

TI  - Orthodontic Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Some 
      Linear Dental Arch Measurements and Preventing Anterior Segment Malocclusion: A 
      Prospective Study.

LID - 1973
AB  - Background and Objectives: Orthodontics is a field that has seen significant 
      advancements in recent years, with technology playing a crucial role in improving 
      diagnosis and treatment planning. The study aimed to implement artificial 
      intelligence to predict the arch width as a preventive measure to avoid future 
      crowding in growing patients or even in adult patients seeking orthodontic 
      treatment as a tool for orthodontic diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Four 
      hundred and fifty intraoral scan (IOS) images were selected from orthodontic 
      patients seeking treatment in private orthodontic centers. Real inter-canine, 
      inter-premolar, and inter-molar widths were measured digitally. Two of the main 
      machine learning models were used: the Python programming language and machine 
      learning algorithms, implementing the data on k-nearest neighbor and linear 
      regression. Results: After the dataset had been implemented on the two ML 
      algorithms, linear regression and k-nearest neighbor, the evaluation metric shows 
      that KNN gives better prediction accuracy than LR does. The resulting accuracy 
      was around 99%. Conclusions: it is possible to leverage machine learning to 
      enhance orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning by predicting linear dental 
      arch measurements and preventing anterior segment malocclusion.

TI  - Deep learning-enabled 3D multimodal fusion of cone-beam CT and intraoral mesh 
      scans for clinically applicable tooth-bone reconstruction.

LID - 100825
AB  - High-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) models of tooth-bone structures are valuable 
      for virtual dental treatment planning; however, they require integrating data 
      from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral scans (IOS) using methods 
      that are either error-prone or time-consuming. Hence, this study presents Deep 
      Dental Multimodal Fusion (DDMF), an automatic multimodal framework that 
      reconstructs 3D tooth-bone structures using CBCT and IOS. Specifically, the DDMF 
      framework comprises CBCT and IOS segmentation modules as well as a multimodal 
      reconstruction module with novel pixel representation learning architectures, 
      prior knowledge-guided losses, and geometry-based 3D fusion techniques. 
      Experiments on real-world large-scale datasets revealed that DDMF achieved 
      superior segmentation performance on CBCT and IOS, achieving a 0.17 mm average 
      symmetric surface distance (ASSD) for 3D fusion with a substantial processing 
      time reduction. Additionally, clinical applicability studies have demonstrated 
      DDMF's potential for accurately simulating tooth-bone structures throughout the 
      orthodontic treatment process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gingival phenotype plays an important role in dental diagnosis and 
      treatment planning. Traditionally, determining the gingival phenotype is done by 
      manual probing of the gingival soft tissues, an invasive and time-consuming 
      procedure. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an 
      alternatively novel, non-invasive technology based on the precise 3-dimension 
      (3D) soft tissue reconstruction from intraoral scanning and cone beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) to predict the gingival biotype. METHODS: As a 
      proof-of-concept, Yorkshire pig mandibles were scanned, and the CBCT data were 
      fed into a deep-learning model to reconstruct the teeth and surrounding bone 
      structure in 3D. By overlaying the CBCT scan with the intraoral scans, an 
      accurate superposition was created and used for virtual measurements of the soft 
      tissue thickness. Meanwhile, gingival thicknesses were also measured by a 
      periodontal probe and digital caliper on the buccal and lingual sides at 3 mm 
      apical to the gingival margin of the posterior teeth and compared with the 
      virtual assessment at the same location. The data obtained from virtual and 
      clinical measurements were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank 
      analysis, while their correlation was determined by Pearson's r value. The 
      Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons of the amount of 
      difference. RESULTS: Among 108 investigated locations, the clinical and virtual 
      measurements are strongly positively correlated (r = 0.9656, P < 0.0001), and 
      only clinically insignificant differences (0.066 ± 0.223 mm) were observed 
      between the two assessments. There is no difference in the agreement between the 
      virtual and clinical measurements on sexually matured samples (0.087 ± 0.240 mm) 
      and pre-pubertal samples (0.033 ± 0.195 mm). Noticeably, there is a greater 
      agreement between the virtual and clinical measurements at the buccal sites 
      (0.019 ± 0.233 mm) than at the lingual sites (0.116 ± 0.215 mm). CONCLUSION: In 
      summary, the artificial intelligence-based virtual measurement proposed in this 
      work provides an innovative technique potentially for accurately measuring soft 
      tissue thickness using clinical routine 3D imaging systems, which will aid 
      clinicians in generating a more comprehensive diagnosis with less invasive 
      procedures and, in turn, optimize the treatment plans with more predictable 
      outcomes.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural network-based automated segmentation and classification 
      of teeth with orthodontic brackets on cone-beam computed-tomographic images: a 
      validation study.
PG  - 169-174
LID - 10.1093/ejo/cjac047 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tooth segmentation and classification from cone-beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) is a prerequisite for diagnosis and treatment planning in the 
      majority of digital dental workflows. However, an accurate and efficient 
      segmentation of teeth in the presence of metal artefacts still remains a 
      challenge. Therefore, the following study aimed to validate an automated deep 
      convolutional neural network (CNN)-based tool for the segmentation and 
      classification of teeth with orthodontic brackets on CBCT images. METHODS: A 
      total of 215 CBCT scans (1780 teeth) were retrospectively collected, consisting 
      of pre- and post-operative images of the patients who underwent combined 
      orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment. All the scans were acquired with 
      NewTom CBCT device. A complete dentition with orthodontic brackets and 
      high-quality images were included. The dataset were randomly divided into three 
      subsets with random allocation of all 32 tooth classes: training set (140 CBCT 
      scans-400 teeth), validation set (35 CBCT scans-100 teeth), and test set 
      (pre-operative: 25, post-operative: 15 = 40 CBCT scans-1280 teeth). A multiclass 
      CNN-based tool was developed and its performance was assessed for automated 
      segmentation and classification of teeth with brackets by comparison with a 
      ground truth. RESULTS: The CNN model took 13.7 ± 1.2 s for the segmentation and 
      classification of all the teeth on a single CBCT image. Overall, the segmentation 
      performance was excellent with a high intersection over union (IoU) of 0.99. 
      Anterior teeth showed a significantly lower IoU (P < 0.05) compared to premolar 
      and molar teeth. The dice similarity coefficient score of anterior (0.99 ± 0.02) 
      and premolar teeth (0.99 ± 0.10) in the pre-operative group was comparable to the 
      post-operative group. The classification of teeth to the correct 32 classes had a 
      high recall rate (99.9%) and precision (99%). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CNN model 
      outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and 
      efficiency. It could act as a viable alternative for automatic segmentation and 
      classification of teeth with brackets. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method 
      could simplify the existing digital workflows of orthodontics, orthognathic 
      surgery, restorative dentistry, and dental implantology by offering an accurate 
      and efficient automated segmentation approach to clinicians, hence further 
      enhancing the treatment predictability and outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that 
      automatically localizes the position of radiographic stent gutta percha (GP) 
      markers in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images to identify proposed 
      implant sites within the images, and to test the performance of the newly 
      developed AI model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four CBCT datasets were used 
      for initial model training, validation and testing. The CBCT datasets were those 
      of patients who had a CBCT examination performed wearing a radiographic stent for 
      implant treatment planning. The datasets were exported in Digital Imaging and 
      Communications in Medicine (DICOM), then imported into the software Horos ®. Each 
      GP marker was manually labelled for object detection and recognition by the deep 
      learning model by drawing rectangles around the GP markers in all axial images, 
      then the labelled images were split into training, validation, and test sets. The 
      axial sections of 30 CBCT datasets were randomly divided into training and 
      validation sets. four CBCT datasets were used for testing the performance of the 
      deep learning model. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the number of GP 
      markers present, number of correct and incorrect identifications of GP markers. 
      RESULT: The AI model had an 83% true positive rate for identification of the GP 
      markers. Of the areas labelled by the AI model as GP markers, 28 % were not truly 
      GP markers, but the overall false positive rate was 2.8 %. CONCLUSION: An AI 
      model for localization of GP markers in CBCT images was able to identify most of 
      the GP markers, but 2.8% of the results were false positive and 17% were missed 
      GP markers. Using only axial images for training an AI program is not enough to 
      give an accurate AI model performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in constant, 
      non-invasive monitoring of daily oral hygiene practices, potentially on behalf of 
      a dentist or healthcare provider. This review summarises the evidence around the 
      use of AI in the context of oral hygiene education. DATA & SOURCES: This scoping 
      review was developed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review 
      protocol guidelines and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Publications that involved the 
      use of AI for oral hygiene education in any population and setting were included. 
      A systematic electronic database search (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Web of 
      Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore, arXiv, Proquest, Google 
      Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PROSPERO) up to, and including 4 February 2023 
      was carried out. Citation searching from the full-text of included publications 
      was also performed. RESULTS: Of the 3215 publications screened, 20 were selected 
      for qualitative synthesis. These were broadly divided into two categories of 
      AI-assisted feedback: (1) synchronous and (2) asynchronous monitoring. There is a 
      lack of high-quality studies, scarce reflection on possible ethical concerns on 
      AI, and of studies comparing qualitative feedback to quantitative clinical 
      outcomes with a control. Barriers to adoption of AI technologies, patient 
      privacy, and specific areas for improvement were identified. CONCLUSION: Within 
      the limitations of this study, the use of AI to modify oral hygiene behaviour is 
      promising. Further work is required in generating higher quality intra-oral 
      images for dental biofilm detection, and in developing more personalised feedback 
      for users. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first review to map out the 
      available literature on AI in providing oral hygiene education. It may be useful 
      to dental researchers in appraising AI-assisted technologies in the context of 
      oral health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Automatic tooth segmentation and classification from cone beam 
      computed tomography (CBCT) have become an integral component of the digital 
      dental workflows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a 
      deep learning approach for an automatic tooth segmentation and classification 
      from CBCT images. METHODS: A dataset of 186 CBCT scans was acquired from two CBCT 
      machines with different acquisition settings. An artificial intelligence (AI) 
      framework was built to segment and classify teeth. Teeth were segmented in a 
      three-step approach with each step consisting of a 3D U-Net and step 2 included 
      classification. The dataset was divided into training set (140 scans) to train 
      the model based on ground-truth segmented teeth, validation set (35 scans) to 
      test the model performance and test set (11 scans) to evaluate the model 
      performance compared to ground-truth. Different evaluation metrics were used such 
      as precision, recall rate and time. RESULTS: The AI framework correctly segmented 
      teeth with optimal precision (0.98±0.02) and recall (0.83±0.05). The difference 
      between the AI model and ground-truth was 0.56±0.38 mm based on 95% Hausdorff 
      distance confirming the high performance of AI compared to ground-truth. 
      Furthermore, segmentation of all the teeth within a scan was more than 1800 times 
      faster for AI compared to that of an expert. Teeth classification also performed 
      optimally with a recall rate of 98.5% and precision of 97.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed 3D U-Net based AI framework is an accurate and time-efficient deep 
      learning system for automatic tooth segmentation and classification without 
      expert refinement. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed system might enable 
      potential future applications for diagnostics and treatment planning in the field 
      of digital dentistry, while reducing clinical workload.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven 
      tool for automated detection of teeth and small edentulous regions on Cone-Beam 
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After AI training and 
      testing with 175 CBCT scans (130 for training and 40 for testing), validation was 
      performed on a total of 46 CBCT scans selected for this purpose. Scans were split 
      into fully dentate and partially dentate patients (small edentulous regions). The 
      AI Driven tool (Virtual Patient Creator, Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium) automatically 
      detected, segmented and labelled teeth and edentulous regions. Human performance 
      served as clinical reference. Accuracy and speed of the AI-driven tool to detect 
      and label teeth and edentulous regions in partially edentulous jaws were 
      assessed. Automatic tooth segmentation was compared to manually refined 
      segmentation and accuracy by means of Intersetion over Union (IoU) and 95% 
      Hausdorff Distance served as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The AI-driven tool 
      achieved a general accuracy of 99.7% and 99% for detection and labelling of teeth 
      and missing teeth for both fully dentate and partially dentate patients, 
      respectively. Automated detections took a median time of 1.5s, while the human 
      operator median time was 98s (P<0.0001). Segmentation accuracy measured by 
      Intersection over Union was 0.96 and 0.97 for fully dentate and partially 
      edentulous jaws respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The AI-driven tool was accurate and 
      fast for CBCT-based detection, segmentation and labelling of teeth and missing 
      teeth in partial edentulism. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of AI may represent a 
      promising time-saving tool serving radiological reporting, with a major step 
      forward towards automated dental charting, as well as surgical and treatment 
      planning.

AB  - Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with 
      significant regional disparities. Early detection of precursor lesions is 
      essential to improve patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, 
      including deep learning and machine learning, have proved to be of assistance to 
      both gastroenterologists and pathologists in the diagnosis and characterization 
      of upper gastrointestinal malignancies by correlating with the histopathology. 
      The primary diagnostic method in gastroenterology is white light endoscopic 
      evaluation, but conventional endoscopy is partially inefficient in detecting 
      esophageal cancer. However, other endoscopic modalities, such as narrow-band 
      imaging, endocytoscopy, and endomicroscopy, have shown improved visualization of 
      mucosal structures and vasculature, which provides a set of baseline data to 
      develop efficient AI-assisted predictive models for quick interpretation. The 
      main challenges in managing esophageal cancer are identifying high-risk patients 
      and the disease's poor prognosis. Thus, AI techniques can play a vital role in 
      improving the early detection and diagnosis of precursor lesions, assisting 
      gastroenterologists in performing targeted biopsies and real-time decisions of 
      endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. Combining AI 
      techniques and endoscopic modalities can enhance the diagnosis and management of 
      esophageal cancer, improving patient outcomes and reducing cancer-related 
      mortality rates. The aim of this review is to grasp a better understanding of the 
      application of AI in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of esophageal cancer 
      and how computer-aided diagnosis and computer-aided detection can act as vital 
      tools for clinicians in the long run.

TI  - Automated Skeletal Classification with Lateral Cephalometry Based on Artificial 
      Intelligence.
PG  - 249-256
LID - 10.1177/0022034520901715 [doi]
AB  - Lateral cephalometry has been widely used for skeletal classification in 
      orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this conventional system, 
      requiring manual tracing of individual landmarks, contains possible errors of 
      inter- and intravariability and is highly time-consuming. This study aims to 
      provide an accurate and robust skeletal diagnostic system by incorporating a 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) into a 1-step, end-to-end diagnostic system 
      with lateral cephalograms. A multimodal CNN model was constructed on the basis of 
      5,890 lateral cephalograms and demographic data as an input. The model was 
      optimized with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. Diagnostic 
      performance was evaluated with statistical analysis. The proposed system 
      exhibited >90% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for vertical and sagittal 
      skeletal diagnosis. Clinical performance of the vertical classification showed 
      the highest accuracy at 96.40 (95% CI, 93.06 to 98.39; model III). The receiver 
      operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve both demonstrated the 
      excellent performance of the system, with a mean area under the curve >95%. The 
      heat maps of cephalograms were also provided for deeper understanding of the 
      quality of the learned model by visually representing the region of the 
      cephalogram that is most informative in distinguishing skeletal classes. In 
      addition, we present broad applicability of this system through subtasks. The 
      proposed CNN-incorporated system showed potential for skeletal orthodontic 
      diagnosis without the need for intermediary steps requiring complicated 
      diagnostic procedures.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is being 
      increasingly used in Orthodontics and craniofacial health for predicting clinical 
      outcomes. Current ML/AI models are prone to accentuate racial disparities. The 
      objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of how AI/ML models 
      perpetuate racial biases and how we can mitigate this situation. A narrative 
      review of articles published in the medical literature on racial biases and the 
      use of AI/ML models was undertaken. Current AI/ML models are built on homogenous 
      clinical datasets that have a gross underrepresentation of historically 
      disadvantages demographic groups, especially the ethno-racial minorities. The 
      consequence of such AI/ML models is that they perform poorly when deployed on 
      ethno-racial minorities thus further amplifying racial biases. Healthcare 
      providers, policymakers, AI developers and all stakeholders should pay close 
      attention to various steps in the pipeline of building AI/ML models and every 
      effort must be made to establish algorithmic fairness to redress inequities.

TI  - Contrast MR-Based Radiomics and Machine Learning Analysis to Assess Clinical 
      Outcomes following Liver Resection in Colorectal Liver Metastases: A Preliminary 
      Study.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14051110 [doi]
LID - 1110
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess radiomics features efficacy obtained by arterial and portal 
      MRI phase in the prediction of clinical outcomes in the colorectal liver 
      metastases patients, evaluating recurrence, mutational status, pathological 
      characteristic (mucinous and tumor budding) and surgical resection margin. 
      METHODS: This retrospective analysis was approved by the local Ethical Committee 
      board, and radiological databases were used to select patients with colorectal 
      liver metastases with pathological proof and MRI study in a pre-surgical setting 
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The cohort of patients included a training set 
      (51 patients with 61 years of median age and 121 liver metastases) and an 
      external validation set (30 patients with single lesion with 60 years of median 
      age). For each segmented volume of interest on MRI by two expert radiologists, 
      851 radiomics features were extracted as median values using the PyRadiomics 
      tool. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, intraclass correlation, receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linear regression modelling and pattern 
      recognition methods (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), 
      artificial neural network (NNET), and decision tree (DT)) were considered. 
      RESULTS: The best predictor to discriminate expansive versus infiltrative tumor 
      growth front was wavelet_LHH_glrlm_ShortRunLowGrayLevelEmphasis extracted on 
      portal phase with accuracy of 82%, sensitivity of 84%, and specificity of 77%. 
      The best predictor to discriminate tumor budding was 
      wavelet_LLH_firstorder_10Percentile extracted on portal phase with accuracy of 
      92%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 81%. The best predictor to 
      differentiate the mucinous type of tumor was the wavelet_LLL_glcm_ClusterTendency 
      extracted on portal phase with accuracy of 88%, a sensitivity of 38%, and a 
      specificity of 100%. The best predictor to identify the recurrence was the 
      wavelet_HLH_ngtdm_Complexity extracted on arterial phase with accuracy of 90%, a 
      sensitivity of 71%, and a specificity of 95%. The best linear regression model 
      was obtained in the identification of mucinous type considering the 13 textural 
      significant metrics extracted by arterial phase (accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 
      77% and a specificity of 99%). The best results were obtained in the 
      identification of tumor budding with the eleven textural significant features 
      extracted by arterial phase using a KNN (accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 84%, and 
      a specificity of 99%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the capacity of 
      radiomics to identify as biomarkers and several prognostic features that could 
      affect the treatment choice in patients with liver metastases in order to obtain 
      a more personalized approach.

AB  - The accuracy of cephalometric landmark identification for malocclusion 
      classification is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. Identifying 
      these landmarks is often complex and time-consuming for orthodontists. An AI 
      model for classification was recently developed. This model was investigated 
      based on current regulatory considerations as a result of the strict regulations 
      on software systems and the lack of information on artificial intelligence (AI) 
      requirements in this publication. The platform developed by the ITU/WHO for AI is 
      used to assess the models of the application. The auditing procedure assessed the 
      development process concerning medical device regulations, data protection 
      regulations, and ethical considerations. Upon that, the major tasks during the 
      development were evaluated, such as qualification, annotation procedure, and data 
      set attributes. The AI models were investigated under consideration of technical, 
      clinical, regulatory, and ethical considerations. The risk to the patient and 
      user's health can be considered low according to the International Medical Device 
      Regulators Forum (IMDRF) definition. This application facilitates the decision 
      and planning of malocclusion treatment based on lateral cephalograms without 
      cephalometric landmarks. It is comparable with common standards in orthodontic 
      diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Surgeons often encounter challenges when treating maxillofacial 
      fractures using conventional methods that involve trimming or bending ready-made 
      titanium plates for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) since it can be 
      time-consuming, imprecise, and inconvenient. This retrospective case series aimed 
      to introduce a novel bone reduction method that utilizes virtual planning, 
      patient-specific surgical guides, and titanium plates. METHODS: Seven patients 
      with mandibular symphysis or subcondylar fractures resulting from facial trauma 
      underwent cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) or facial CT scans, and their 
      medical histories were documented. Virtual surgery was conducted based on 
      three-dimensional (3D) stereolithography images derived from CT scans using the 
      FaceGide software (MegaGen, Daegu, Korea). ORIF was performed using 
      patient-specific surgical guides and plates that were designed, printed, and 
      milled. Radiographic, clinical, and occlusal evaluations were conducted at two 
      weeks and six weeks postoperatively. Subsequently, 3D images from virtual surgery 
      and postoperative CT scans were compared. RESULTS: The comparison of 3D virtual 
      surgery and postoperative images revealed minimal surface differences of less 
      than 1 mm. T-scan evaluations indicated that there were no statistically 
      significant differences between the two- and six-week postoperative assessments. 
      Favorable clinical outcomes were observed. CONCLUSION: This novel method 
      demonstrated stable outcomes in terms of occlusion and healing, with no notable 
      complications. Consequently, this approach may serve as a viable alternative to 
      conventional methods. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Facial fracture surgery that 
      utilizes patient-specific surgical guides and plates within a digital workflow 
      can facilitate meticulous surgical planning, reducing the risk of complications 
      and minimizing operation time.

AB  - Early detection and accurate prediction of the risk of early childhood caries 
      (ECC) are essential for effective prevention and management. This systematic 
      review aims to assess the performance and applicability of machine learning 
      algorithms in ECC prediction and detection. A comprehensive search was conducted 
      to identify studies utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict or detect 
      ECC. The included (n = 6) studies demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values 
      related to predicting and detecting ECC. The application of machine learning 
      algorithms contributed to enhanced clinical decision-making, targeted preventive 
      measures, and improved ECC management. The studies also highlighted the 
      importance of considering multiple factors, including demographic, environmental, 
      and genetic factors, when developing dental caries prediction models. Machine 
      learning algorithms hold significant potential for ECC prediction and detection, 
      having promising performance outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, 
      no meta-analysis could be performed. Moreover, further research is needed to 
      explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of integrating these 
      algorithms into dental practice. This approach would ultimately contribute to 
      enabling more effective and personalized dental caries management and improved 
      oral health outcomes for diverse populations.

TI  - Fusion extracted features from deep learning for identification of multiple 
      positioning errors in dental panoramic imaging.
PG  - 1315-1332
LID - 10.3233/XST-230171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental panoramic imaging plays a pivotal role in dentistry for 
      diagnosis and treatment planning. However, correctly positioning patients can be 
      challenging for technicians due to the complexity of the imaging equipment and 
      variations in patient anatomy, leading to positioning errors. These errors can 
      compromise image quality and potentially result in misdiagnoses. OBJECTIVE: This 
      research aims to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of accurately 
      and efficiently identifying multiple positioning errors in dental panoramic 
      imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study used 552 panoramic 
      images selected from a hospital Picture Archiving and Communication System 
      (PACS). We defined six types of errors (E1-E6) namely, (1) slumped position, (2) 
      chin tipped low, (3) open lip, (4) head turned to one side, (5) head tilted to 
      one side, and (6) tongue against the palate. First, six Convolutional Neural 
      Network (CNN) models were employed to extract image features, which were then 
      fused using transfer learning. Next, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied 
      to create a classifier for multiple positioning errors, using the fused image 
      features. Finally, the classifier performance was evaluated using 3 indices of 
      precision, recall rate, and accuracy. RESULTS: Experimental results show that the 
      fusion of image features with six binary SVM classifiers yielded high accuracy, 
      recall rates, and precision. Specifically, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 
      0.832 for identifying multiple positioning errors. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that six SVM classifiers effectively identify multiple positioning 
      errors in dental panoramic imaging. The fusion of extracted image features and 
      the employment of SVM classifiers improve diagnostic precision, suggesting 
      potential enhancements in dental imaging efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. 
      Future research should consider larger datasets and explore real-time clinical 
      application.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Supports Decision Making during Open-Chest Surgery of 
      Rare Congenital Heart Defects.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10225330 [doi]
LID - 5330
AB  - The human right ventricle is barely monitored during open-chest surgery due to 
      the absence of intraoperative imaging techniques capable of elaborating its 
      complex function. Accordingly, artificial intelligence could not be adopted for 
      this specific task. We recently proposed a video-based approach for the real-time 
      evaluation of the epicardial kinematics to support medical decisions. Here, we 
      employed two supervised machine learning algorithms based on our technique to 
      predict the patients' outcomes before chest closure. Videos of the beating hearts 
      were acquired before and after pulmonary valve replacement in twelve Tetralogy of 
      Fallot patients and recordings were properly labeled as the "unhealthy" and 
      "healthy" classes. We extracted frequency-domain-related features to train 
      different supervised machine learning models and selected their best 
      characteristics via 10-fold cross-validation and optimization processes. Decision 
      surfaces were built to classify two additional patients having good and 
      unfavorable clinical outcomes. The k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine 
      showed the highest prediction accuracy; the patients' class was identified with a 
      true positive rate ≥95% and the decision surfaces correctly classified the 
      additional patients in the "healthy" (good outcome) or "unhealthy" (unfavorable 
      outcome) classes. We demonstrated that classifiers employed with our video-based 
      technique may aid cardiac surgeons in decision making before chest closure.

TI  - Predicting clinical outcomes using cancer progression associated signatures.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.27934 [doi]
AB  - Somatic mutation signatures are an informative facet of cancer aetiology, however 
      they are rarely useful for predicting patient outcome. The aim of this study is 
      to evaluate the utility of a panel of 142 mutation-signature-associated metrics 
      (P142) for predicting cancer progression in patients from a 'TCGA PanCancer 
      Atlas' cohort. The P142 metrics are comprised of AID/APOBEC and ADAR deaminase 
      associated SNVs analyzed for codon context, strand bias, and 
      transitions/transversions. TCGA tumor-normal mutation data was obtained for 
      10,437 patients, representing 31 of the most prevalent forms of cancer. 
      Stratified random sampling was used to split patients into training, tuning and 
      validation cohorts for each cancer type. Cancer specific machine learning 
      (XGBoost) models were built using the output from the P142 panel to predict 
      patient Progression Free Survival (PFS) status as either "High PFS" or "Low PFS". 
      Predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the validation cohort. 
      Models accurately predicted PFS status for several cancer types, including 
      adrenocortical carcinoma, glioma, mesothelioma, and sarcoma. In conclusion, the 
      P142 panel of metrics successfully predicted cancer progression status in 
      patients with some, but not all cancer types analyzed. These results pave the way 
      for future studies on cancer progression associated signatures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the accuracy, consistency, and 
      time-efficiency of a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based model 
      for the automated maxillofacial bone segmentation from cone beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) images. METHOD: A dataset of 144 scans was acquired from two 
      CBCT devices and randomly divided into three subsets: training set (n = 110), 
      validation set (n = 10) and testing set (n = 24). A three-dimensional (3D) U-Net 
      (CNN) model was developed, and the achieved automated segmentation was compared 
      with a manual approach. RESULTS: The average time required for automated 
      segmentation was 39.1 s with a 204-fold decrease in time consumption compared to 
      manual segmentation (132.7 min). The model was highly accurate for identification 
      of the bony structures of the anatomical region of interest with a dice 
      similarity coefficient (DSC) of 92.6%. Additionally, the fully deterministic 
      nature of the CNN model was able to provide 100% consistency without any 
      variability. The inter-observer consistency for expert-based minor correction of 
      the automated segmentation observed an excellent DSC of 99.7%. CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed CNN model provided a time-efficient, accurate, and consistent CBCT-based 
      automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex could act as an alternative 
      to the conventional segmentation techniques for improving the efficiency of the 
      digital workflows. This approach could deliver accurate and ready-to-print3D 
      models, essential to patient-specific digital treatment planning for 
      orthodontics, maxillofacial surgery, and implant dentistry.

TI  - Accuracy of Digital Orthodontic Treatment Planning: Assessing Aligner-Directed 
      Tooth Movements and Exploring Inherent Intramaxillary Side Effects.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13082298 [doi]
LID - 2298
AB  - Background: The attainment of precise posterior occlusion alignment necessitates 
      a deeper understanding of the clinical efficacy of aligner therapy. This study 
      aims to determine whether the treatment goals defined in the virtual planning of 
      aligner therapy are effectively implemented in clinical practice, with a 
      particular focus on the influence of distalization distances on potential 
      vertical side effects. Methods: In this retrospective, non-interventional 
      investigation, a cohort of 20 individuals undergoing Invisalign(®) treatment was 
      examined. Pre- and post-treatment maxillary clinical and ClinCheck(®) casts were 
      superimposed utilizing a surface-surface matching algorithm on palatal folds, 
      median palatine raphe, and unmoved teeth as the stable references. The 
      effectivity of planned versus clinical movements was evaluated. Groupings were 
      based on distalization distances, planned vertical movements, and Class II 
      elastic prescription. Statistics were performed with a two-sample t-test and 
      p-value < 0.05. Results: Clinically achieved distalization was significantly 
      lower than virtually planned distalization, regardless of additional vertical 
      movements, where a lack of implementation was contingent upon the extent of 
      distalization, with no mitigating effects observed with the application of Class 
      II elastics. Intriguingly, no adverse vertical side effects were noted; however, 
      the intended intrusions or extrusions, as per the therapeutic plans, remained 
      unattainable regardless of the magnitude of distalization. Conclusions: These 
      findings underscore the imperative for future investigations to delve deeper into 
      the intricacies surrounding translational mesio-distal and vertical movements, 
      thereby enhancing predictability within orthodontic practice. To facilitate 
      successful clinical implementation of vertical and translational movements via 
      aligners, the incorporation of sliders emerges as a promising strategy for 
      bolstering anchorage reinforcement.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess patient-, tooth- and treatment-level covariates on 
      the failure of root canal treatments (RT) and to predict failure using machine 
      learning (ML). METHODS: Teeth receiving RT at one large university hospital from 
      2016 to 2020 with a minimum follow-up of ≥6 months were included. Failure 
      compromised absent radiographic healing and/or the presence of clinical symptoms. 
      Covariates were selected on tooth-, treatment- and patient-level. We used 
      logistic regression (logR) to determine associations in the full dataset, and 
      logR as well as more advanced ML (random forests (RF), gradient boosting machine 
      (GBM) and extremely gradient boosting (XGB)) for predictive modeling 
      (area-under-the-receiver operating characteristic-curve (ROCAUC)) and testing on 
      a separate test dataset. RESULTS: 458 patients (female/male 47.2/52.8%) with 591 
      permanent teeth were included (overall success rate 79.5%). In logR, tooth-level 
      covariates showed strong associations with failure: Alveolar bone loss 66-100% 
      (ABL, OR 6.48, 95% CI [2.86, 14.89], p<0.001); Periapical index (PAI) score≥4 (OR 
      4.59, [2.44, 8.79], p<0.001); ABL 33-66% (OR 2.59 [1.49, 4.49], p<0.001); PAI=3 
      (OR 2.45, [1.43, 4.34], p<0.01); Treatment type "retreatment" (OR 1.77, [1.01, 
      2.86], p<0.01). On patient level only smoking (OR 2.05, [1.18, 3.53], p<0.05) was 
      significantly associated with risk of failure. For predictive modeling, the 
      predictive power of all models was limited (ROCAUC: logR 0.63, [0.53, 0.73]; GBM 
      0.59, [0.50, 0.68]; RF 0.59, [0.50, 0.68]; XGB 0.60, [0.50, 0.70]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Failure of RT was associated mainly with tooth-level covariates. Predicting 
      failure was only limitedly possible, also with more complex ML. CLINICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying specific risk factors for failure of RT and predicting 
      the outcome of RT is relevant for treatment planning and informed shared 
      decision-making. The present study found tooth-level factors to be associated 
      with failure. Notably, predicting failure was only limitedly possible.

TI  - Deep Multi-Scale Mesh Feature Learning for Automated Labeling of Raw Dental 
      Surfaces From 3D Intraoral Scanners.
PG  - 2440-2450
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2020.2971730 [doi]
AB  - Precisely labeling teeth on digitalized 3D dental surface models is the 
      precondition for tooth position rearrangements in orthodontic treatment planning. 
      However, it is a challenging task primarily due to the abnormal and varying 
      appearance of patients' teeth. The emerging utilization of intraoral scanners 
      (IOSs) in clinics further increases the difficulty in automated tooth labeling, 
      as the raw surfaces acquired by IOS are typically low-quality at gingival and 
      deep intraoral regions. In recent years, some pioneering end-to-end methods 
      (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the communities of computer vision and 
      graphics to consume directly raw surface for 3D shape segmentation. Although 
      these methods are potentially applicable to our task, most of them fail to 
      capture fine-grained local geometric context that is critical to the 
      identification of small teeth with varying shapes and appearances. In this paper, 
      we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method, called MeshSegNet, for automated 
      tooth labeling on raw dental surfaces. Using multiple raw surface attributes as 
      inputs, MeshSegNet integrates a series of graph-constrained learning modules 
      along its forward path to hierarchically extract multi-scale local contextual 
      features. Then, a dense fusion strategy is applied to combine local-to-global 
      geometric features for the learning of higher-level features for mesh cell 
      annotation. The predictions produced by our MeshSegNet are further post-processed 
      by a graph-cut refinement step for final segmentation. We evaluated MeshSegNet 
      using a real-patient dataset consisting of raw maxillary surfaces acquired by 3D 
      IOS. Experimental results, performed 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrate that 
      MeshSegNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 
      3D shape segmentation.

AB  - Cephalometric analysis is a fundamental examination which is widely used in 
      orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Its key step is to detect the 
      anatomical landmarks in lateral cephalograms, which is time-consuming in 
      traditional manual way. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach with a 
      cascaded three-stage convolutional neural networks to predict cephalometric 
      landmarks automatically. In the first stage, high-level features of the 
      craniofacial structures are extracted to locate the lateral face area which helps 
      to overcome the appearance variations. Next, we process the aligned face area to 
      estimate the locations of all landmarks simultaneously. At the last stage, each 
      landmark is refined through a dedicated network using high-resolution image data 
      around the initial position to achieve more accurate result. We evaluate the 
      proposed method on several anatomical landmark datasets and the experimental 
      results show that our method achieved competitive performance compared with the 
      other methods.

TI  - Predicting root fracture after root canal treatment and crown installation using 
      deep learning.
PG  - 587-593
LID - 10.1016/j.jds.2023.10.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vertical root fracture (VRF) is a prevalent reason for tooth 
      extraction following root canal treatment and even after crown placement. 
      Predicting fractures is challenging due to multifactorial nature. The current 
      study aimed to predict the likelihood of fracture following root canal treatment 
      and crown placement by developing a deep learning (DL) model. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: DL techniques were employed to analyze a dataset comprising 145 clinical 
      cases consisting of 97 fractured teeth and 48 non-fractured teeth. This dataset 
      spanned a five-year period and encompassed cases involving root canal therapy and 
      crown installation. The analysis identified several root fracture-related 
      parameters, which were incorporated into the DL system. The dataset consisted of 
      17 features presented in a mixed-type tabular format. RESULTS: The deep neural 
      network (DNN) model surpassed the support vector machine (SVM) model with a 
      higher accuracy (80.7 % vs. 71.7 %) and F1-score value (0.857 vs. 0.817) for 
      predicting root fracture. Furthermore, in determining root fracture occurrence, 
      it was observed that 17 significant characteristics in the DNN model outperformed 
      the 7 features by 11.7 % in accuracy and 10 % in F1-score. CONCLUSION: DL shows 
      promise in predicting root fracture post root canal therapy and prosthesis, and 
      it may have the potential to aid clinicians in assessing fracture risk and 
      improving decision-making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Precision healthcare has entered a new era because of the 
      developments in personalized medicine, especially in the diagnosis and treatment 
      of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This paper explores the dynamic 
      landscape of personalized medicine as applied to HNSCC, encompassing both current 
      developments and future prospects. RECENT FINDINGS: The integration of 
      personalized medicine strategies into HNSCC diagnosis is driven by the 
      utilization of genetic data and biomarkers. Epigenetic biomarkers, which reflect 
      modifications to DNA that can influence gene expression, have emerged as valuable 
      indicators for early detection and risk assessment. Treatment approaches within 
      the personalized medicine framework are equally promising. Immunotherapy, gene 
      silencing, and editing techniques, including RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9, 
      offer innovative means to modulate gene expression and correct genetic 
      aberrations driving HNSCC. The integration of stem cell research with 
      personalized medicine presents opportunities for tailored regenerative 
      approaches. The synergy between personalized medicine and technological 
      advancements is exemplified by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
      (ML) applications. These tools empower clinicians to analyze vast datasets, 
      predict patient responses, and optimize treatment strategies with unprecedented 
      accuracy. CONCLUSION: The developments and prospects of personalized medicine in 
      HNSCC diagnosis and treatment offer a transformative approach to managing this 
      complex malignancy. By harnessing genetic insights, biomarkers, immunotherapy, 
      gene editing, stem cell therapies, and advanced technologies like AI and ML, 
      personalized medicine holds the key to enhancing patient outcomes and ushering in 
      a new era of precision oncology.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the accuracy of deep neural patchworks (DNPs), a 
      deep learning-based segmentation framework, for automated identification of 60 
      cephalometric landmarks (bone-, soft tissue- and tooth-landmarks) on CT scans. 
      The aim was to determine whether DNP could be used for routine three-dimensional 
      cephalometric analysis in diagnostics and treatment planning in orthognathic 
      surgery and orthodontics. METHODS: Full skull CT scans of 30 adult patients (18 
      female, 12 male, mean age 35.6 years) were randomly divided into a training and 
      test data set (each n = 15). Clinician A annotated 60 landmarks in all 30 CT 
      scans. Clinician B annotated 60 landmarks in the test data set only. The DNP was 
      trained using spherical segmentations of the adjacent tissue for each landmark. 
      Automated landmark predictions in the separate test data set were created by 
      calculating the center of mass of the predictions. The accuracy of the method was 
      evaluated by comparing these annotations to the manual annotations. RESULTS: The 
      DNP was successfully trained to identify all 60 landmarks. The mean error of our 
      method was 1.94 mm (SD 1.45 mm) compared to a mean error of 1.32 mm (SD 1.08 mm) 
      for manual annotations. The minimum error was found for landmarks ANS 1.11 mm, SN 
      1.2 mm, and CP_R 1.25 mm. CONCLUSION: The DNP-algorithm was able to accurately 
      identify cephalometric landmarks with mean errors <2 mm. This method could 
      improve the workflow of cephalometric analysis in orthodontics and orthognathic 
      surgery. Low training requirements while still accomplishing high precision make 
      this method particularly promising for clinical use.

AB  - In dentistry, practitioners interpret various dental X-ray imaging modalities to 
      identify tooth-related problems, abnormalities, or teeth structure changes. 
      Another aspect of dental imaging is that it can be helpful in the field of 
      biometrics. Human dental image analysis is a challenging and time-consuming 
      process due to the unspecified and uneven structures of various teeth, and hence 
      the manual investigation of dental abnormalities is at par excellence. However, 
      automation in the domain of dental image segmentation and examination is 
      essentially the need of the hour in order to ensure error-free diagnosis and 
      better treatment planning. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive 
      survey of dental image segmentation and analysis by investigating more than 130 
      research works conducted through various dental imaging modalities, such as 
      various modes of X-ray, CT (Computed Tomography), CBCT (Cone Beam Computed 
      Tomography), etc. Overall state-of-the-art research works have been classified 
      into three major categories, i.e., image processing, machine learning, and deep 
      learning approaches, and their respective advantages and limitations are 
      identified and discussed. The survey presents extensive details of the 
      state-of-the-art methods, including image modalities, pre-processing applied for 
      image enhancement, performance measures, and datasets utilized.

TI  - Performance of the caries diagnosis feature of intraoral scanners and 
      near-infrared imaging technology-A narrative review.
PG  - 114-124
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13770 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various dental 
      caries diagnostic techniques, including the use of intraoral scanners for caries 
      diagnosis based on near-infrared imaging (NIR) technology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      A MEDLINE search from 1980-2023 focused on dental caries diagnostic techniques, 
      emphasizing intraoral scanners using NIR technology. Alternative caries detection 
      methods were also evaluated for their advantages and limitations, enabling a 
      comparison with NIR. The review included traditional caries tools, the latest 
      detection methods, and NIR's role in intraoral scanners, drawing from case 
      reports and both in vivo and in vitro studies. Keywords like "caries detection," 
      "intraoral scanners," and "Near Infrared Imaging (NIRI)" guided the search. After 
      screening titles and abstracts for relevance, full texts with valuable insights 
      were thoroughly analyzed. The data was grouped into three: traditional 
      diagnostics, advanced digital methods, and intraoral scanner-based detection. 
      RESULTS: This comprehensive narrative review described and discussed the current 
      state of dental caries diagnostic methods, given the insufficient number of 
      clinical investigations suitable for a systematic review. Traditional caries 
      diagnosis techniques have shown variable accuracy dependent on a dentist's 
      experience and the potential over-removal of healthy tooth structures. Intraoral 
      scanners have emerged as a novel caries detection method, because of their 
      integration of NIR technology. Various studies have confirmed the efficacy of NIR 
      in detecting interproximal caries and in the early diagnosis of non-cavitated 
      caries. Specifically, intraoral scanners have demonstrated promising results, 
      proving comparable to established diagnostic methods like bitewing radiography. 
      Nevertheless, while the integration of NIR into intraoral scanners seems 
      promising, the technology still faces challenges, notably its accuracy in 
      detecting secondary and subgingival cavities. However, with anticipated 
      integrations of AI, NIR in intraoral scanners could revolutionize early caries 
      detection. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral scanners with NIR technology offer 
      non-destructive imaging, real-time lesion visuals, and enhanced patient 
      communication. Although comparable to bitewing radiography in some studies, a 
      universally accepted diagnostic tool is lacking. Future research should compare 
      them with existing methods, focusing on clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, 
      and patient acceptance.

TI  - Application of machine learning for diagnostic prediction of root caries.
PG  - 395-404
LID - 10.1111/ger.12432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to utilise machine learning methods in artificial 
      intelligence to select the most relevant variables in classifying the presence 
      and absence of root caries and to evaluate the model performance. BACKGROUND: 
      Dental caries is one of the most prevalent oral health problems. Artificial 
      intelligence can be used to develop models for identification of root caries risk 
      and to gain valuable insights, but it has not been applied in dentistry. 
      Accurately identifying root caries may guide treatment decisions, leading to 
      better oral health outcomes. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2015-2016 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and were randomly divided into 
      training and test sets. Several supervised machine learning methods were applied 
      to construct a tool that was capable of classifying variables into the presence 
      and absence of root caries. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the 
      receiver operating curve were computed. RESULTS: Of the machine learning 
      algorithms developed, support vector machine demonstrated the best performance 
      with an accuracy of 97.1%, precision of 95.1%, sensitivity of 99.6% and 
      specificity of 94.3% for identifying root caries. The area under the curve was 
      0.997. Age was the feature most strongly associated with root caries. CONCLUSION: 
      The machine learning algorithms developed in this study perform well and allow 
      for clinical implementation and utilisation by dental and nondental 
      professionals. Clinicians are encouraged to adopt the algorithms from this study 
      for early intervention and treatment of root caries for the ageing population of 
      the United States, and for attaining precision dental medicine.

AB  - The practicability of deep learning techniques has been demonstrated by their 
      successful implementation in varied fields, including diagnostic imaging for 
      clinicians. In accordance with the increasing demands in the healthcare industry, 
      techniques for automatic prediction and detection are being widely researched. 
      Particularly in dentistry, for various reasons, automated mandibular canal 
      detection has become highly desirable. The positioning of the inferior alveolar 
      nerve (IAN), which is one of the major structures in the mandible, is crucial to 
      prevent nerve injury during surgical procedures. However, automatic segmentation 
      using Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) poses certain difficulties, such as 
      the complex appearance of the human skull, limited number of datasets, unclear 
      edges, and noisy images. Using work-in-progress automation software, experiments 
      were conducted with models based on 2D SegNet, 2D and 3D U-Nets as preliminary 
      research for a dental segmentation automation tool. The 2D U-Net with adjacent 
      images demonstrates higher global accuracy of 0.82 than naïve U-Net variants. The 
      2D SegNet showed the second highest global accuracy of 0.96, and the 3D U-Net 
      showed the best global accuracy of 0.99. The automated canal detection system 
      through deep learning will contribute significantly to efficient treatment 
      planning and to reducing patients' discomfort by a dentist. This study will be a 
      preliminary report and an opportunity to explore the application of deep learning 
      to other dental fields.

AB  - PURPOSE: The cancer research community is constantly evolving to better 
      understand tumor biology, disease etiology, risk stratification, and pathways to 
      novel treatments. Yet the clinical cancer genomics field has been hindered by 
      redundant efforts to meaningfully collect and interpret disparate data types from 
      multiple high-throughput modalities and integrate into clinical care processes. 
      Bespoke data models, knowledgebases, and one-off customized resources for data 
      analysis often lack adequate governance and quality control needed for these 
      resources to be clinical grade. Many informatics efforts focused on genomic 
      interpretation resources for neoplasms are underway to support data collection, 
      deposition, curation, harmonization, integration, and analytics to support case 
      review and treatment planning. METHODS: In this review, we evaluate and summarize 
      the landscape of available tools, resources, and evidence used in the evaluation 
      of somatic and germline tumor variants within the context of molecular tumor 
      boards. RESULTS: Molecular tumor boards (MTBs) are collaborative efforts of 
      multidisciplinary cancer experts equipped with genomic interpretation resources 
      to aid in the delivery of accurate and timely clinical interpretations of complex 
      genomic results for each patient, within an institution or hospital network. 
      Virtual MTBs (VMTBs) provide an online forum for collaborative governance, 
      provenance, and information sharing between experts outside a given hospital 
      network with the potential to enhance MTB discussions. Knowledge sharing in VMTBs 
      and communication with guideline-developing organizations can lead to progress 
      evidenced by data harmonization across resources, crowd-sourced and 
      expert-curated genomic assertions, and a more informed and explainable usage of 
      artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: Advances in cancer genomics interpretation 
      aid in better patient and disease classification, more streamlined identification 
      of relevant literature, and a more thorough review of available treatments and 
      predicted patient outcomes.

TI  - Revolutionizing radiation therapy: the role of AI in clinical practice.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1093/jrr/rrad090 [doi]
AB  - This review provides an overview of the application of artificial intelligence 
      (AI) in radiation therapy (RT) from a radiation oncologist's perspective. Over 
      the years, advances in diagnostic imaging have significantly improved the 
      efficiency and effectiveness of radiotherapy. The introduction of AI has further 
      optimized the segmentation of tumors and organs at risk, thereby saving 
      considerable time for radiation oncologists. AI has also been utilized in 
      treatment planning and optimization, reducing the planning time from several days 
      to minutes or even seconds. Knowledge-based treatment planning and deep learning 
      techniques have been employed to produce treatment plans comparable to those 
      generated by humans. Additionally, AI has potential applications in quality 
      control and assurance of treatment plans, optimization of image-guided RT and 
      monitoring of mobile tumors during treatment. Prognostic evaluation and 
      prediction using AI have been increasingly explored, with radiomics being a 
      prominent area of research. The future of AI in radiation oncology offers the 
      potential to establish treatment standardization by minimizing inter-observer 
      differences in segmentation and improving dose adequacy evaluation. RT 
      standardization through AI may have global implications, providing world-standard 
      treatment even in resource-limited settings. However, there are challenges in 
      accumulating big data, including patient background information and correlating 
      treatment plans with disease outcomes. Although challenges remain, ongoing 
      research and the integration of AI technology hold promise for further 
      advancements in radiation oncology.

TI  - Convolutional neural network for automatic maxillary sinus segmentation on 
      cone-beam computed tomographic images.

AB  - An accurate three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the maxillary sinus is crucial 
      for multiple diagnostic and treatment applications. Yet, it is challenging and 
      time-consuming when manually performed on a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
      dataset. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to provide 
      excellent performance in the field of 3D image analysis. Hence, this study 
      developed and validated a novel automated CNN-based methodology for the 
      segmentation of maxillary sinus using CBCT images. A dataset of 264 sinuses were 
      acquired from 2 CBCT devices and randomly divided into 3 subsets: training, 
      validation, and testing. A 3D U-Net architecture CNN model was developed and 
      compared to semi-automatic segmentation in terms of time, accuracy, and 
      consistency. The average time was significantly reduced (p-value < 2.2e-16) by 
      automatic segmentation (0.4 min) compared to semi-automatic segmentation 
      (60.8 min). The model accurately identified the segmented region with a dice 
      similarity co-efficient (DSC) of 98.4%. The inter-observer reliability for minor 
      refinement of automatic segmentation showed an excellent DSC of 99.6%. The 
      proposed CNN model provided a time-efficient, precise, and consistent automatic 
      segmentation which could allow an accurate generation of 3D models for diagnosis 
      and virtual treatment planning.

      cephalograms. In this study, we applied an ensemble of regression trees to solve 
      this problem. We found that despite the limited size of manually labeled images, 
      we can improve the performance of landmark detection by augmenting the training 
      set using a battery of simple image transforms. We further demonstrated the 
      calculation of second-order features encoding the relative locations of 
      landmarks, which are diagnostically more important than individual landmarks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the perspectives, familiarity, 
      and readiness of dental faculty members regarding the integration and application 
      of artificial intelligence (AI) in dentistry, with a focus on the possible 
      effects on dental education and clinical practice. METHODOLOGY: In a mix-method 
      cross-sectional quantitative and quantitative study conducted between June 1st 
      and August 30th, 2023, the perspectives of faculty members from a public sector 
      dental college in Pakistan regarding the function of AI were explored. This study 
      used qualitative as well as quantitative techniques to analyse faculty's 
      viewpoints on the subject. The sample size was comprised of twenty-three faculty 
      members. The quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, while 
      the qualitative data was analysed using theme analysis. RESULTS: 
      Position-specific differences in faculty familiarity underscore the value of 
      individualized instruction. Surprisingly few had ever come across AI concepts in 
      their professional lives. Nevertheless, many acknowledged that AI had the 
      potential to improve patient outcomes. The majority thought AI would improve 
      dentistry education. Participants suggested a few dental specialties where AI 
      could be useful. CONCLUSION: The study emphasizes the significance of addressing 
      in dental professionals' knowledge gaps about AI. The promise of AI in dentistry 
      calls for specialized training and teamwork between academic institutions and AI 
      developers. Graduates of dentistry programs who use AI are better prepared to 
      navigate shifting environments. The study highlights the positive effects of AI 
      and the value of faculty involvement in maximizing its potential for better 
      dental education and practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Due to advancing digitalisation, it is of interest to develop 
      standardised and reproducible fully automated analysis methods of cranial 
      structures in order to reduce the workload in diagnosis and treatment planning 
      and to generate objectifiable data. The aim of this study was to train and 
      evaluate an algorithm based on deep learning methods for fully automated 
      detection of craniofacial landmarks in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in 
      terms of accuracy, speed, and reproducibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 
      931 CBCTs were used to train the algorithm. To test the algorithm, 35 landmarks 
      were located manually by three experts and automatically by the algorithm in 114 
      CBCTs. The time and distance between the measured values and the ground truth 
      previously determined by an orthodontist were analyzed. Intraindividual 
      variations in manual localization of landmarks were determined using 50 CBCTs 
      analyzed twice. RESULTS: The results showed no statistically significant 
      difference between the two measurement methods. Overall, with a mean error of 
      2.73 mm, the AI was 2.12% better and 95% faster than the experts. In the area of 
      bilateral cranial structures, the AI was able to achieve better results than the 
      experts on average. CONCLUSION: The achieved accuracy of automatic landmark 
      detection was in a clinically acceptable range, is comparable in precision to 
      manual landmark determination, and requires less time. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Further enlargement of the database and continued development and optimization of 
      the algorithm may lead to ubiquitous fully automated localization and analysis of 
      CBCT datasets in future routine clinical practice.

      Teeth in a Pediatric Patient.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13233563 [doi]
LID - 3563
AB  - We present a very rare case of a child with nine supernumerary teeth to analyze 
      the potential, benefits, and limitations of artificial intelligence, as well as 
      two commercial tools for tooth segmentation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is 
      increasingly finding applications in dentistry today, particularly in 
      radiography. Special attention is given to models based on convolutional neural 
      networks (CNN) and their application in automatic segmentation of the oral cavity 
      and tooth structures. The integration of AI is gaining increasing attention, and 
      the automation of the detection and localization of supernumerary teeth can 
      accelerate the treatment planning process. Despite advancements in 3D 
      segmentation techniques, relying on trained professionals remains crucial. 
      Therefore, human expertise should remain key, and AI should be seen as a support 
      rather than a replacement. Generally, a comprehensive tool that can satisfy all 
      clinical needs in terms of supernumerary teeth and their segmentation is not yet 
      available, so it is necessary to incorporate multiple tools into practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to develop an automatic pipeline for analyzing 
      mandibular shape asymmetry in 3-dimensions. METHODS: Forty patients with skeletal 
      Class I pattern and 80 patients with skeletal Class III pattern were used. The 
      mandible was automatically segmented from the cone-beam computed tomography 
      images using a U-net deep learning network. A total of 17,415 uniformly sampled 
      quasi-landmarks were automatically identified on the mandibular surface via a 
      template mapping technique. After alignment with the robust Procrustes 
      superimposition, the pointwise surface-to-surface distance between original and 
      reflected mandibles was visualized in a color-coded map, indicating the location 
      of asymmetry. The degree of overall mandibular asymmetry and the asymmetry of 
      subskeletal units were scored using the root-mean-squared-error between the left 
      and right sides. These asymmetry parameters were compared between the skeletal 
      Class I and skeletal Class III groups. RESULTS: The mandible shape was 
      significantly more asymmetrical in patients with skeletal Class III pattern with 
      positional asymmetry. The condyles were identified as the most asymmetric region 
      in all groups, followed by the coronoid process and the ramus. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      automated approach to quantify mandibular shape asymmetry will facilitate 
      high-throughput image processing for big data analysis. The spatially-dense 
      landmarks allow for evaluating mandibular asymmetry over the entire surface, 
      which overcomes the information loss inherent in conventional linear distance or 
      angular measurements. Precise quantification of the asymmetry can provide 
      important information for individualized diagnosis and treatment planning in 
      orthodontics and orthognathic surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Analyzing three-dimensional cone beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) images has become an indispensable procedure for diagnosis and 
      treatment planning of orthodontic patients. Artificial intelligence, especially 
      deep-learning techniques for analyzing image data, shows great potential for 
      medical and dental image analysis and diagnosis. To explore the feasibility of 
      automating measurement of 13 geometric parameters from three-dimensional cone 
      beam computed tomography images taken in natural head position (NHP), this study 
      proposed a smart system that combined a facial profile analysis algorithm with 
      deep-learning models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using multiple views extracted from 
      the cone beam computed tomography data of 170 cases as a dataset, our proposed 
      method automatically calculated 13 dental parameters by partitioning, detecting 
      regions of interest, and extracting the facial profile. Subsequently, Mask-RCNN, 
      a trained decentralized convolutional neural network was applied to detect 23 
      landmarks. All the techniques were integrated into a software application with a 
      graphical user interface designed for user convenience. To demonstrate the 
      system's ability to replace human experts, 30 CBCT data were selected for 
      validation. Two orthodontists and one advanced general dentist located required 
      landmarks by using a commercial dental program. The differences between manual 
      and developed methods were calculated and reported as the errors. RESULTS: The 
      intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
      for intra-observer reliability were 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for observer 1; 0.95 
      (0.93-0.97) for observer 2; 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for observer 3 after measuring 13 
      parameters two times at two weeks interval. The combined ICC for intra-observer 
      reliability was 0.97. The ICCs and 95% CI for inter-observer reliability were 
      0.94 (0.91-0.97). The mean absolute value of deviation was around 1 mm for the 
      length parameters, and smaller than 2° for angle parameters. Furthermore, ANOVA 
      test demonstrated the consistency between the measurements of the proposed method 
      and those of human experts statistically (F(dis)=2.68, ɑ=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed system demonstrated the high consistency with the manual measurements of 
      human experts and its applicability. This method aimed to help human experts save 
      time and efforts for analyzing three-dimensional CBCT images of orthodontic 
      patients.

TI  - Classification of Maxillofacial Morphology by Artificial Intelligence Using 
      Cephalometric Analysis Measurements.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13132134 [doi]
LID - 2134
AB  - The characteristics of maxillofacial morphology play a major role in orthodontic 
      diagnosis and treatment planning. While Sassouni's classification scheme outlines 
      different categories of maxillofacial morphology, there is no standardized 
      approach to assigning these classifications to patients. This study aimed to 
      create an artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses cephalometric analysis 
      measurements to accurately classify maxillofacial morphology, allowing for the 
      standardization of maxillofacial morphology classification. This study used the 
      initial cephalograms of 220 patients aged 18 years or older. Three orthodontists 
      classified the maxillofacial morphologies of 220 patients using eight 
      measurements as the accurate classification. Using these eight cephalometric 
      measurement points and the subject's gender as input features, a random forest 
      classifier from the Python sci-kit learning package was trained and tested with a 
      k-fold split of five to determine orthodontic classification; distinct models 
      were created for horizontal-only, vertical-only, and combined maxillofacial 
      morphology classification. The accuracy of the combined facial classification was 
      0.823 ± 0.060; for anteroposterior-only classification, the accuracy was 0.986 ± 
      0.011; and for the vertical-only classification, the accuracy was 0.850 ± 0.037. 
      ANB angle had the greatest feature importance at 0.3519. The AI model created in 
      this study accurately classified maxillofacial morphology, but it can be further 
      improved with more learning data input.

AB  - DATA SOURCES: Electronic scientific databases Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO 
      and Web of Science were systematically searched and restricted to articles 
      published from 1996 onwards and limited to articles published in English. This 
      was carried out following an initial scoping search using keywords conducted in 
      PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: Original studies investigating the use of mobile phone 
      applications as a delivery method of healthcare interventions to parents and 
      caregivers with children ≤6 years of age were included. As this was a 
      mixed-methods systematic review, studies that have quantitative clinical outcomes 
      and also qualitative outcomes of experiences, attitudes and beliefs of parents 
      and caregivers were included. EndNote X8.2 and Rayyan.ai software was employed 
      for title and abstract screening. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three 
      independent authors developed a combined data extraction tool to examine titles, 
      abstracts and full texts of relevant articles against the inclusion criteria. The 
      development of this tool was guided by the JBI reviewer's manual. Data extraction 
      was completed by one reviewer, and verified by two further reviewers. 
      Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Retrieved studies were assessed in 
      accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data extracted included study reference 
      information, study design, setting, sample sizes and intervention 
      characteristics. A risk of bias assessment was undertaken using the Quality 
      Appraisal for Diverse Studies tool, and a further risk assessment of quantitative 
      and mixed methods studies. RESULTS: From 5953 studies initially identified, 5 
      studies were included in the review. One study identified using a gamification 
      design within a mobile health app to promote oral health had statistically 
      significant improvements in plaque and gingival indices compared to a control 
      group at both a 6 and 12-week recall. Two studies reported a significant 
      improvement in maternal knowledge of children's oral health as a result of using 
      an oral health app. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of oral health promotion through 
      mobile health apps may be effective in reducing early childhood caries through 
      improving health literacy in parents and caregivers, however key challenges in 
      the app development process exist surrounding privacy issues and data protection.

LID - 523
AB  - Multi-modal three-dimensional (3-D) image segmentation is used in many medical 
      applications, such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-guided 
      surgery. Although multi-modal images provide information that no single image 
      modality alone can provide, integrating such information to be used in 
      segmentation is a challenging task. Numerous methods have been introduced to 
      solve the problem of multi-modal medical image segmentation in recent years. In 
      this paper, we propose a solution for the task of brain tumor segmentation. To 
      this end, we first introduce a method of enhancing an existing magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) dataset by generating synthetic computed tomography (CT) images. 
      Then, we discuss a process of systematic optimization of a convolutional neural 
      network (CNN) architecture that uses this enhanced dataset, in order to customize 
      it for our task. Using publicly available datasets, we show that the proposed 
      method outperforms similar existing methods.

TI  - Unlocking the Potential: Investigating Dental Practitioners' Willingness to 
      Embrace Artificial Intelligence in Dental Practice.
PG  - e55107
LID - 10.7759/cureus.55107 [doi]
LID - e55107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for 
      transforming healthcare delivery, including dentistry. However, the successful 
      integration of AI into dental practice necessitates an understanding of dental 
      professionals' perspectives, attitudes, and readiness to adopt AI technology. 
      This study aimed to explore dental professionals' perceptions, attitudes, and 
      practices regarding AI adoption in dentistry. METHODS: This cross-sectional study 
      was conducted among 256 dental professionals using an online questionnaire. 
      Participants were assessed for familiarity with AI technology, perceived barriers 
      to adoption, attitudes towards AI, current usage patterns, and factors 
      influencing adoption decisions. Data are analysed using descriptive statistics, 
      including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. Inferential 
      statistics, such as chi-square tests and regression analysis, were employed to 
      examine associations between variables and identify predictors of AI adoption in 
      dentistry. RESULTS: The study surveyed 256 dental professionals from various 
      regions across India, primarily aged 30 to 50 years (mean age: 42.6), with a 
      nearly equal gender split (male: 48.4%, female: 51.6%) and high educational 
      attainment (67.8% with master's or doctoral degrees). Private practices were 
      predominant (56.3%). The diagnostic algorithms and treatment planning software 
      were well known (77.3% and 70.3% familiarity, respectively). Technical concerns 
      (average score: 3.82 ± 0.68) were the main barriers to AI adoption, followed by 
      financial considerations (average score: 3.45 ± 0.72), ethical and legal issues 
      (average score: 3.21 ± 0.65), and organizational factors (average score: 3.67 ± 
      0.71). Despite these concerns, most participants had positive attitudes towards 
      AI (70.3% agreed). Current usage varied, with diagnostic support and 
      administrative tasks being the most common (44.5% and 82.8% usage, respectively). 
      Perceived utility (average score: 4.12 ± 0.75) and ease of use (average score: 
      3.98 ± 0.69) significantly influenced adoption, as identified by regression 
      analysis (perceived utility: β = 0.342, p < 0.001; ease of use: β = 0.267, p = 
      0.005). CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into AI adoption in 
      dentistry, highlighting the multifaceted nature of barriers and facilitators that 
      influence dental professionals' adoption decisions. Strategies to promote AI 
      adoption should address practical considerations, ethical concerns, and 
      educational needs to facilitate the integration of AI technology into dental 
      practices.

TI  - What is next for screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation? Artificial 
      intelligence may hold the key.
PG  - 391-397
LID - 10.1093/ehjqcco/qcab094 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common, though often undiagnosed, 
      leaving many people untreated and at elevated risk of ischaemic stroke. Current 
      European guidelines do not recommend systematic screening for AF, even though a 
      number of studies have shown that periods of serial or continuous rhythm 
      monitoring in older people in the general population increase detection of AF and 
      the prescription of oral anticoagulation. This article discusses the conflicting 
      results of two contemporary landmark trials, STROKESTOP and the LOOP, which 
      provided the first evidence on whether screening for AF confers a benefit for 
      people in terms of clinical outcomes. The benefit and efficiency of systematic 
      screening for AF in the general population could be optimized by targeting 
      screening to only those at higher risk of developing AF. For this purpose, 
      evidence is emerging that prediction models developed using artificial 
      intelligence in routinely collected electronic health records can provide strong 
      discriminative performance for AF and increase detection rates when combined with 
      rhythm monitoring in a clinical study. We consider future directions for 
      investigation in this field and how this could be best aligned to the current 
      evidence base to target screening in people at elevated risk of stroke.

TI  - Improving resolution of panoramic radiographs: super-resolution concept.
PG  - 240-247
LID - 10.1093/dmfr/twae009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dental imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of 
      dental conditions, yet limitations regarding the quality and resolution of dental 
      radiographs sometimes hinder precise analysis. Super-resolution with deep 
      learning refers to a set of techniques used to enhance the resolution of images 
      beyond their original size or quality using deep neural networks instead of 
      traditional image interpolation methods which often result in blurred or 
      pixelated images when attempting to increase resolution. Leveraging advancements 
      in technology, this study aims to enhance the resolution of dental panoramic 
      radiographs, thereby enabling more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning. 
      METHODS: About 1714 panoramic radiographs from 3 different open datasets are used 
      for training (n = 1364) and testing (n = 350). The state of the art 4 different 
      models is explored, namely Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), 
      Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network, Super-Resolution Generative 
      Adversarial Network, and Autoencoder. Performances in reconstructing 
      high-resolution dental images from low-resolution inputs with different scales 
      (s = 2, 4, 8) are evaluated by 2 well-accepted metrics Structural Similarity 
      Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). RESULTS: SSIM spans between 
      0.82 and 0.98 while PSNR are between 28.7 and 40.2 among all scales and models. 
      SRCNN provides the best performance. Additionally, it is observed that 
      performance decreased when images are scaled with higher values. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings highlight the potential of super-resolution concepts to significantly 
      improve the quality and detail of dental panoramic radiographs, thereby 
      contributing to enhanced interpretability.

TI  - A deep learning based framework for the registration of three dimensional 
      multi-modal medical images of the head.
PG  - 1860
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-81044-7 [doi]
LID - 1860
AB  - Image registration is a fundamental task in image analysis in which the transform 
      that moves the coordinate system of one image to another is calculated. 
      Registration of multi-modal medical images has important implications for 
      clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-guided surgery as it provides 
      the means of bringing together complimentary information obtained from different 
      image modalities. However, since different image modalities have different 
      properties due to their different acquisition methods, it remains a challenging 
      task to find a fast and accurate match between multi-modal images. Furthermore, 
      due to reasons such as ethical issues and need for human expert intervention, it 
      is difficult to collect a large database of labelled multi-modal medical images. 
      In addition, manual input is required to determine the fixed and moving images as 
      input to registration algorithms. In this paper, we address these issues and 
      introduce a registration framework that (1) creates synthetic data to augment 
      existing datasets, (2) generates ground truth data to be used in the training and 
      testing of algorithms, (3) registers (using a combination of deep learning and 
      conventional machine learning methods) multi-modal images in an accurate and fast 
      manner, and (4) automatically classifies the image modality so that the process 
      of registration can be fully automated. We validate the performance of the 
      proposed framework on CT and MRI images of the head obtained from a publicly 
      available registration database.

TI  - Accuracy of Artificial Intelligence Models in the Prediction of Periodontitis: A 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 23800844241232318
LID - 10.1177/23800844241232318 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis is the main cause of tooth loss and is related to 
      many systemic diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) in periodontics has the 
      potential to improve the accuracy of risk assessment and provide personalized 
      treatment planning for patients with periodontitis. This systematic review aims 
      to examine the actual evidence on the accuracy of various AI models in predicting 
      periodontitis. METHODS: Using a mix of MeSH keywords and free text words pooled 
      by Boolean operators ('AND', 'OR'), a search strategy without a time frame 
      setting was conducted on the following databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, 
      PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Explore. The QUADAS-2 risk of bias assessment was then 
      performed. RESULTS: From a total of 961 identified records screened, 8 articles 
      were included for qualitative analysis: 4 studies showed an overall low risk of 
      bias, 2 studies an unclear risk, and the remaining 2 studies a high risk. The 
      most employed algorithms for periodontitis prediction were artificial neural 
      networks, followed by support vector machines, decision trees, logistic 
      regression, and random forest. The models showed good predictive performance for 
      periodontitis according to different evaluation metrics, but the presented 
      methods were heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: AI algorithms may improve in the future 
      the accuracy and reliability of periodontitis prediction. However, to date, most 
      of the studies had a retrospective design and did not consider the most modern 
      deep learning networks. Although the available evidence is limited by a lack of 
      standardized data collection and protocols, the potential benefits of using AI in 
      periodontics are significant and warrant further research and development in this 
      area. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The use of AI in periodontics can lead to 
      more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as improved patient 
      education and engagement. Despite the current challenges and limitations of the 
      available evidence, particularly the lack of standardized data collection and 
      analysis protocols, the potential benefits of using AI in periodontics are 
      significant and warrant further research and development in this area.

TI  - Developing Children's Oral Health Assessment Toolkits Using Machine Learning 
      Algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluating children's oral health status and treatment needs is 
      challenging. We aim to build oral health assessment toolkits to predict 
      Children's Oral Health Status Index (COHSI) score and referral for treatment 
      needs (RFTN) of oral health. Parent and Child toolkits consist of short-form 
      survey items (12 for children and 8 for parents) with and without children's 
      demographic information (7 questions) to predict the child's oral health status 
      and need for treatment. METHODS: Data were collected from 12 dental practices in 
      Los Angeles County from 2015 to 2016. We predicted COHSI score and RFTN using 
      random Bootstrap samples with manually introduced Gaussian noise together with 
      machine learning algorithms, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting and Naive Bayesian 
      algorithms (using R). The toolkits predicted the probability of treatment needs 
      and the COHSI score with percentile (ranking). The performance of the toolkits 
      was evaluated internally and externally by residual mean square error (RMSE), 
      correlation, sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The toolkits were developed 
      based on survey responses from 545 families with children aged 2 to 17 y. The 
      sensitivity and specificity for predicting RFTN were 93% and 49% respectively 
      with the external data. The correlation(s) between predicted and clinically 
      determined COHSI was 0.88 (and 0.91 for its percentile). The RMSEs of the COHSI 
      toolkit were 4.2 for COHSI (and 1.3 for its percentile). CONCLUSIONS: Survey 
      responses from children and their parents/guardians are predictive for clinical 
      outcomes. The toolkits can be used by oral health programs at baseline among 
      school populations. The toolkits can also be used to quantify differences between 
      pre- and post-dental care program implementation. The toolkits' predicted oral 
      health scores can be used to stratify samples in oral health research. KNOWLEDGE 
      TRANSFER STATEMENT: This study creates the oral health toolkits that combine 
      self- and proxy- reported short forms with children's demographic characteristics 
      to predict children's oral health and treatment needs using Machine Learning 
      algorithms. The toolkits can be used by oral health programs at baseline among 
      school populations to quantify differences between pre and post dental care 
      program implementation. The toolkits can also be used to stratify samples 
      according to the treatment needs and oral health status.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the reliability of cephalometric landmark identification by 
      an automated tracing software based on convolutional neural networks to human 
      tracers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty cephalograms were traced by two 
      board-certified orthodontists and AudaxCeph®'s artificial intelligence software. 
      The following thirteen landmarks were identified in each tracing: Sella, Nasion, 
      A point, B point, Porion, Menton, Pogonion, Orbitale, Gonion, Upper Central 
      Incisor Incisal Edge (U1 Tip), Upper Central Incisor Root Apex (U1 apex), Lower 
      Central Incisor Incisal Edge (L1 Tip), Lower Central Incisor Root Apex (L1 apex). 
      An x-y axis was positioned in the bottom left corner of each cephalogram, and the 
      x- and y-coordinates for the landmarks were exported into Excel. Distributions of 
      landmarks (X, Y, radial distance) were compared using t-tests of equivalence with 
      a 2mm equivalence bound. These compared the AI position to the two 
      orthodontists - and the orthodontists' reliability by comparing equivalence 
      against each other. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the 
      orthodontists and AudaxCeph®'s automatic tracing software except for the x- and 
      y-dimension of Porion and the y-dimension of L1 apex. The two orthodontists had 
      good intra-examiner reliability with no statistical difference found when 
      comparing them. CONCLUSION: AudaxCeph®'s automated cephalometric tracing software 
      is a good adjunctive tool to use when diagnosing and treatment planning 
      orthodontic cases.

TI  - A Novel Deep Learning-Based Approach for Segmentation of Different Type Caries 
      Lesions on Panoramic Radiographs.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics13020202 [doi]
LID - 202
AB  - The study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an artificial 
      intelligence system based on deep learning for the segmentation of occlusal, 
      proximal and cervical caries lesions on panoramic radiographs. The study included 
      504 anonymous panoramic radiographs obtained from the radiology archive of Inonu 
      University Faculty of Dentistry's Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology 
      from January 2018 to January 2020. This study proposes Dental Caries Detection 
      Network (DCDNet) architecture for dental caries segmentation. The main difference 
      between DCDNet and other segmentation architecture is that the last part of 
      DCDNet contains a Multi-Predicted Output (MPO) structure. In MPO, the final 
      feature map split into three different paths for detecting occlusal, proximal and 
      cervical caries. Extensive experimental analyses were executed to analyze the 
      DCDNet network architecture performance. In these comparison results, while the 
      proposed model achieved an average F1-score of 62.79%, the highest average 
      F1-score of 15.69% was achieved with the state-of-the-art segmentation models. 
      These results show that the proposed artificial intelligence-based model can be 
      one of the indispensable auxiliary tools of dentists in the diagnosis and 
      treatment planning of carious lesions by enabling their detection in different 
      locations with high success.

TI  - Caries and Restoration Detection Using Bitewing Film Based on Transfer Learning 
      with CNNs.
LID - 10.3390/s21134613 [doi]
LID - 4613
AB  - Caries is a dental disease caused by bacterial infection. If the cause of the 
      caries is detected early, the treatment will be relatively easy, which in turn 
      prevents caries from spreading. The current common procedure of dentists is to 
      first perform radiographic examination on the patient and mark the lesions 
      manually. However, the work of judging lesions and markings requires professional 
      experience and is very time-consuming and repetitive. Taking advantage of the 
      rapid development of artificial intelligence imaging research and technical 
      methods will help dentists make accurate markings and improve medical treatments. 
      It can also shorten the judgment time of professionals. In addition to the use of 
      Gaussian high-pass filter and Otsu's threshold image enhancement technology, this 
      research solves the problem that the original cutting technology cannot extract 
      certain single teeth, and it proposes a caries and lesions area analysis model 
      based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can identify caries and 
      restorations from the bitewing images. Moreover, it provides dentists with more 
      accurate objective judgment data to achieve the purpose of automatic diagnosis 
      and treatment planning as a technology for assisting precision medicine. A 
      standardized database established following a defined set of steps is also 
      proposed in this study. There are three main steps to generate the image of a 
      single tooth from a bitewing image, which can increase the accuracy of the 
      analysis model. The steps include (1) preprocessing of the dental image to obtain 
      a high-quality binarization, (2) a dental image cropping procedure to obtain 
      individually separated tooth samples, and (3) a dental image masking step which 
      masks the fine broken teeth from the sample and enhances the quality of the 
      training. Among the current four common neural networks, namely, AlexNet, 
      GoogleNet, Vgg19, and ResNet50, experimental results show that the proposed 
      AlexNet model in this study for restoration and caries judgments has an accuracy 
      as high as 95.56% and 90.30%, respectively. These are promising results that lead 
      to the possibility of developing an automatic judgment method of bitewing film.

TI  - Intraoral Scanners: The Key to Dentistry's Digital Revolution.
PG  - 154-156
AB  - Dentistry is undergoing a radical evolution with the adoption of digital 
      technologies and, in particular, intraoral scanners (IOSs) skyrocketing 
      worldwide. In some developed countries, as many as 40% to 50% of practitioners 
      are using these devices, and this percentage is expected to continue to rise 
      globally.1 With considerable advancement having occurred in dentistry over the 
      past decade, this is an exciting time for the profession. Dentistry is 
      dramatically changing, and with the advent of AI diagnostics, intraoral scanning 
      data, 3D printing, and CAD/CAM software, it is highly conceivable that diagnostic 
      methods, treatment planning, and treatment execution will continue to rapidly 
      change over the course of the next 5 to 10 years. For practitioners still without 
      a scanner, it is time to accept the inevitable and make the investment. It is 
      indeed an interesting time to be a dentist.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Tooth-Gingiva Trim Lines on Dental Surfaces.
PG  - 3194-3204
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2023.3263161 [doi]
AB  - Detecting the tooth-gingiva trim line from a dental surface plays a critical role 
      in dental treatment planning and aligner 3D printing. Existing methods treat this 
      task as a segmentation problem, which is resolved with geometric deep learning 
      based mesh segmentation techniques. However, these methods can only provide 
      indirect results (i.e., segmented teeth) and suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy 
      due to the incapability of making full use of high-resolution dental surfaces. To 
      this end, we propose a two-stage geometric deep learning framework for 
      automatically detecting tooth-gingiva trim lines from dental surfaces. Our 
      framework consists of a trim line proposal network (TLP-Net) for predicting an 
      initial trim line from the low-resolution dental surface as well as a trim line 
      refinement network (TLR-Net) for refining the initial trim line with the 
      information from the high-resolution dental surface. Specifically, our TLP-Net 
      predicts the initial trim line by fusing the multi-scale features from a U-Net 
      with a proposed residual multi-scale attention fusion module. Moreover, we 
      propose feature bridge modules and a trim line loss to further improve the 
      accuracy. The resulting trim line is then fed to our TLR-Net, which is a 
      deep-based LDDMM model with the high-resolution dental surface as input. In 
      addition, dense connections are incorporated into TLR-Net for improved 
      performance. Our framework provides an automatic solution to trim line detection 
      by making full use of raw high-resolution dental surfaces. Extensive experiments 
      on a clinical dental surface dataset demonstrate that our TLP-Net and TLR-Net are 
      superior trim line detection methods and outperform cutting-edge methods in both 
      qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TI  - A Question-and-Answer System to Extract Data From Free-Text Oncological Pathology 
      Reports (CancerBERT Network): Development Study.
PG  - e27210
LID - 10.2196/27210 [doi]
LID - e27210
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information in pathology reports is critical for cancer care. Natural 
      language processing (NLP) systems used to extract information from pathology 
      reports are often narrow in scope or require extensive tuning. Consequently, 
      there is growing interest in automated deep learning approaches. A powerful new 
      NLP algorithm, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), 
      was published in late 2018. BERT set new performance standards on tasks as 
      diverse as question answering, named entity recognition, speech recognition, and 
      more. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a BERT-based system to 
      automatically extract detailed tumor site and histology information from 
      free-text oncological pathology reports. METHODS: We pursued three specific aims: 
      extract accurate tumor site and histology descriptions from free-text pathology 
      reports, accommodate the diverse terminology used to indicate the same pathology, 
      and provide accurate standardized tumor site and histology codes for use by 
      downstream applications. We first trained a base language model to comprehend the 
      technical language in pathology reports. This involved unsupervised learning on a 
      training corpus of 275,605 electronic pathology reports from 164,531 unique 
      patients that included 121 million words. Next, we trained a question-and-answer 
      (Q&A) model that connects a Q&A layer to the base pathology language model to 
      answer pathology questions. Our Q&A system was designed to search for the answers 
      to two predefined questions in each pathology report: What organ contains the 
      tumor? and What is the kind of tumor or carcinoma? This involved supervised 
      training on 8197 pathology reports, each with ground truth answers to these 2 
      questions determined by certified tumor registrars. The data set included 214 
      tumor sites and 193 histologies. The tumor site and histology phrases extracted 
      by the Q&A model were used to predict International Classification of Diseases 
      for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3), site and histology codes. This involved 
      fine-tuning two additional BERT models: one to predict site codes and another to 
      predict histology codes. Our final system includes a network of 3 BERT-based 
      models. We call this CancerBERT network (caBERTnet). We evaluated caBERTnet using 
      a sequestered test data set of 2050 pathology reports with ground truth answers 
      determined by certified tumor registrars. RESULTS: caBERTnet's accuracies for 
      predicting group-level site and histology codes were 93.53% (1895/2026) and 97.6% 
      (1993/2042), respectively. The top 5 accuracies for predicting fine-grained 
      ICD-O-3 site and histology codes with 5 or more samples each in the training data 
      set were 92.95% (1794/1930) and 96.01% (1853/1930), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      have developed an NLP system that outperforms existing algorithms at predicting 
      ICD-O-3 codes across an extensive range of tumor sites and histologies. Our new 
      system could help reduce treatment delays, increase enrollment in clinical trials 
      of new therapies, and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori remains high in the older population. 
      Specific age-related peculiarities may impact the outcomes of H. pylori 
      treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostics and effectiveness 
      of H. pylori eradication between the younger and older European populations. 
      "European Registry on H. pylori Management (Hp-EuReg)" data from 2013 to 2022 
      were analyzed. Patients were divided into older (≥ 60 years) and younger 
      (18-59 years) groups. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) 
      analysis was performed. 49,461 patients included of which 14,467 (29%) were 
      older-aged. Concomitant medications and penicillin allergy were more frequent 
      among the older patients. Differences between younger and older populations were 
      observed in treatment duration in first-line treatment and in proton pump 
      inhibitors (PPIs) doses in second-line treatment. The overall incidence of 
      adverse events was lower in the older adults group. The overall first-line 
      treatment mITT effectiveness was 88% in younger and 90% in the older patients 
      (p < 0.05). The overall second-line mITT treatment effectiveness was 84% in both 
      groups. The effectiveness of the most frequent first- and second-line triple 
      therapies was suboptimal (< 90%) in both groups. Optimal efficacy (≥ 90%) was 
      achieved by using bismuth and non-bismuth-based quadruple therapies. In 
      conclusion, the approach to the diagnostics and treatment of H. pylori infection 
      did not generally differ between younger and older patients. Main differences 
      were reported in the concurrent medications, allergy to penicillin and adverse 
      events both in first- and second-line treatment. Optimal effectiveness rates were 
      mostly achieved by using bismuth and non-bismuth-based quadruple therapies. No 
      clinically relevant differences in the effectiveness between the age groups were 
      observed.

TI  - Multimodal optical imaging with real-time projection of cancer risk and biopsy 
      guidance maps for early oral cancer diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 016002

LID - 016002
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: Despite recent advances in multimodal optical imaging, oral imaging 
      systems often do not provide real-time actionable guidance to the clinician who 
      is making biopsy and treatment decisions. AIM: We demonstrate a low-cost, 
      portable active biopsy guidance system (ABGS) that uses multimodal optical 
      imaging with deep learning to directly project cancer risk and biopsy guidance 
      maps onto oral mucosa in real time. APPROACH: Cancer risk maps are generated 
      based on widefield autofluorescence images and projected onto the at-risk tissue 
      using a digital light projector. Microendoscopy images are obtained from at-risk 
      areas, and multimodal image data are used to calculate a biopsy guidance map, 
      which is projected onto tissue. RESULTS: Representative patient examples 
      highlight clinically actionable visualizations provided in real time during an 
      imaging procedure. Results show multimodal imaging with cancer risk and biopsy 
      guidance map projection offers a versatile, quantitative, and precise tool to 
      guide biopsy site selection and improve early detection of oral cancers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ABGS provides direct visible guidance to identify early lesions 
      and locate appropriate sites to biopsy within those lesions. This represents an 
      opportunity to translate multimodal imaging into real-time clinically actionable 
      visualizations to help improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Role of TRAIL-R in Primary and Secondary Genital and Respiratory Chlamydia 
      muridarum Infections in Mice.
PG  - e0161722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01617-22 [doi]
LID - e01617-22
AB  - The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 
      (TRAIL-R) suppresses inflammation and could therefore affect the course of 
      Chlamydia infections and their long-term sequelae. Wild-type (WT) and 
      TRAIL-R(-/-) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated vaginally with Chlamydia muridarum; the 
      course of the infection was followed with vaginal cultures and the presence of 
      hydrosalpinx determined. To evaluate the role of TRAIL-R following a secondary 
      infection, the mice were vaginally reinfected. WT and TRAIL-R(-/-) male mice were 
      also infected and reinfected in the respiratory tract, and the course of the 
      diseases and the infections were followed. Following the primary and secondary 
      vaginal infection, no significant differences in vaginal shedding or hydrosalpinx 
      formation were observed between the WT and TRAIL-R(-/-) mice. The WT and 
      TRAIL-R(-/-) mice mounted antibody responses in serum and vaginal washes that 
      were not significantly different. After the primary and secondary intranasal 
      infections of the male mice, changes in body weight were determined, and no 
      significant differences were observed between the WT and TRAIL-R(-/-) mice. Ten 
      days after the primary and the secondary infections, the weight of the lungs and 
      number of C. muridarum inclusion forming units (IFU) were determined. The lungs 
      of the WT mice weighed less compared with the TRAIL-R(-/-) mice following a 
      primary infection but not after a secondary infection. No differences in the 
      number of C. muridarum IFU in the lungs were observed between the two groups of 
      mice. In conclusion, despite playing a role in inflammation cell-signaling 
      pathways in vitro, TRAIL-R does not appear to play a major role in the 
      susceptibility, clinical outcomes, or long-term sequelae of C. muridarum 
      infections in vivo. IMPORTANCE TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 
      (TRAIL-R) is involved in suppressing inflammatory responses. Bacterial pathogens 
      such as Chlamydia spp. elicit inflammatory responses in humans following genital, 
      ocular, and respiratory infections. The inflammatory responses are important to 
      control the spread of Chlamydia. However, in certain instances, these 
      inflammatory responses can produce long-term sequelae, including fibrosis. 
      Fibrosis, or scarring, in the genital tract, eye, and respiratory system results 
      in functional deficiencies, including infertility, blindness, and chronic 
      obstructive lung disease, respectively. The goal of this study was to determine 
      if mice deficient in TRAIL-R infected in the genital and respiratory tracts with 
      Chlamydia spp. suffer more or less severe infections, infertility, or lung 
      diseases than wild-type mice. Our results show no differences between the immune 
      responses, infection severity, and long-term sequelae between TRAIL-R knockout 
      and wild-type animals following a genital or a respiratory infection with 
      Chlamydia.

TI  - Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence in Cleft Lip and Palate: An 
      In-Depth Analysis from Diagnosis to Treatment, a Comprehensive Review.
LID - 10.3390/children11020140 [doi]
LID - 140
AB  - Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is the most common craniofacial malformation, with a 
      range of physical, psychological, and aesthetic consequences. In this 
      comprehensive review, our main objective is to thoroughly examine the 
      relationship between CLP anomalies and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
      children. Additionally, we aim to explore how the integration of AI technology 
      can bring about significant advancements in the fields of diagnosis, treatment 
      methods, and predictive outcomes. By analyzing the existing evidence, we will 
      highlight state-of-the-art algorithms and predictive AI models that play a 
      crucial role in achieving precise diagnosis, susceptibility assessment, and 
      treatment planning for children with CLP anomalies. Our focus will specifically 
      be on the efficacy of alveolar bone graft and orthodontic interventions. The 
      findings of this review showed that deep learning (DL) models revolutionize the 
      diagnostic process, predict susceptibility to CLP, and enhance alveolar bone 
      grafts and orthodontic treatment. DL models surpass human capabilities in terms 
      of precision, and AI algorithms applied to large datasets can uncover the 
      intricate genetic and environmental factors contributing to CLP. Additionally, 
      Machine learning aids in preoperative planning for alveolar bone grafts and 
      provides personalized treatment plans in orthodontic treatment. In conclusion, 
      these advancements inspire optimism for a future where AI seamlessly integrates 
      with CLP management, augmenting its analytical capabilities.

TI  - EOB-MR Based Radiomics Analysis to Assess Clinical Outcomes following Liver 
      Resection in Colorectal Liver Metastases.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14051239 [doi]
LID - 1239
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of radiomics features obtained 
      by EOB-MRI phase in order to predict clinical outcomes following liver resection 
      in Colorectal Liver Metastases Patients, and evaluate recurrence, mutational 
      status, pathological characteristic (mucinous) and surgical resection margin. 
      This retrospective analysis was approved by the local Ethical Committee board of 
      National Cancer of Naples, IRCCS "Fondazione Pascale". Radiological databases 
      were interrogated from January 2018 to May 2021 in order to select patients with 
      liver metastases with pathological proof and EOB-MRI study in pre-surgical 
      setting. The cohort of patients included a training set (51 patients with 61 
      years of median age and 121 liver metastases) and an external validation set (30 
      patients with single lesion with 60 years of median age). For each segmented 
      volume of interest by 2 expert radiologists, 851 radiomics features were 
      extracted as median values using PyRadiomics. non-parametric test, intraclass 
      correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linear regression 
      modelling and pattern recognition methods (support vector machine (SVM), 
      k-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural network (NNET), and decision tree 
      (DT)) were considered. The best predictor to discriminate expansive versus 
      infiltrative front of tumor growth was HLH_glcm_MaximumProbability extraxted on 
      VIBE_FA30 with an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 
      82%. The best predictor to discriminate tumor budding was Inverse Variance 
      obtained by the original GLCM matrix extraxted on VIBE_FA30 with an accuracy of 
      89%, a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 65%. The best predictor to 
      differentiate the mucinous type of tumor was the HHL_glszm_ZoneVariance extraxted 
      on VIBE_FA30 with an accuracy of 85%, a sensitivity of 46% and a specificity of 
      95%. The best predictor to identify tumor recurrence was the LHL_glcm_Correlation 
      extraxted on VIBE_FA30 with an accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 52% and a 
      specificity of 97%. The best linear regression model was obtained in the 
      identification of the tumor growth front considering the height textural 
      significant metrics by VIBE_FA10 (an accuracy of 89%; sensitivity of 93% and a 
      specificity of 82%). Considering significant texture metrics tested with pattern 
      recognition approaches, the best performance for each outcome was reached by a 
      KNN in the identification of recurrence with the 3 textural significant features 
      extracted by VIBE_FA10 (AUC of 91%, an accuracy of 93%; sensitivity of 99% and a 
      specificity of 77%). Ours results confirmed the capacity of radiomics to identify 
      as biomarkers, several prognostic features that could affect the treatment choice 
      in patients with liver metastases, in order to obtain a more personalized 
      approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the performance, time-efficiency, and consistency of a 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) based automated approach for integrated 
      segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures compared with semi-automated 
      method for creating a virtual patient using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
      scans. METHODS: Thirty CBCT scans were selected. Six craniomaxillofacial 
      structures, encompassing the maxillofacial complex bones, maxillary sinus, 
      dentition, mandible, mandibular canal, and pharyngeal airway space, were 
      segmented on these scans using semi-automated and composite of previously 
      validated CNN-based automated segmentation techniques for individual structures. 
      A qualitative assessment of the automated segmentation revealed the need for 
      minor refinements, which were manually corrected. These refined segmentations 
      served as a reference for comparing semi-automated and automated integrated 
      segmentations. RESULTS: The majority of minor adjustments with the automated 
      approach involved under-segmentation of sinus mucosal thickening and regions with 
      reduced bone thickness within the maxillofacial complex. The automated and the 
      semi-automated approaches required an average time of 1.1 min and 48.4 min, 
      respectively. The automated method demonstrated a greater degree of similarity 
      (99.6 %) to the reference than the semi-automated approach (88.3 %). The standard 
      deviation values for all metrics with the automated approach were low, indicating 
      a high consistency. CONCLUSIONS: The CNN-driven integrated segmentation approach 
      proved to be accurate, time-efficient, and consistent for creating a CBCT-derived 
      virtual patient through simultaneous segmentation of craniomaxillofacial 
      structures. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The creation of a virtual orofacial patient using 
      an automated approach could potentially transform personalized digital workflows. 
      This advancement could be particularly beneficial for treatment planning in a 
      variety of dental and maxillofacial specialties.

TI  - Perceptions in Digital Smile Design: Assessing Laypeople and Dental 
      Professionals' Preferences Using an Artificial-Intelligence-Based Application.

LID - 104
AB  - Digital Smile Design (DSD) is used in many fields of dentistry. This prospective 
      observational study assessed laypeople's and dental professionals' perceptions of 
      a DSD application. SmileCloud, an online DSD platform, was used to create two 
      different designs for three patients; after that, the participants, in a 
      30-question online illustrated survey, were asked about the most attractive 
      design and other features of the smile. Dentists' and laypeople's perceptions 
      about specific DSD features were assessed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test 
      was used. Descriptive and crosstab analyses compared the respondents' opinions 
      for each statement. Chi-square tests were used to determine the relationship 
      between the questions and any association with age, gender, and profession. The 
      test results were rated as significant at a p-value < 0.05. A total of 520 
      participants (dental professionals, students, dental technicians, and laypeople) 
      were enrolled. The statistically significant features were self-esteem related to 
      appearance (p = 0.05), facial and smile symmetry (p = 0.42, p < 0.0001), tooth 
      color (p = 0.012), and symmetry of gums (p < 0.001). For each patient, the design 
      with dominant round upper incisors and perfect symmetry was preferred (p < 
      0.001). Digital pre-visualization benefits diagnosis and enriches treatment 
      planning. The dentist-dental technician-patient team should be involved in the 
      decision-making process of pre-visualization.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving field, with modern technological 
      advances and the growth of electronic health data opening new possibilities in 
      diagnostic radiology. In recent years, the performance of deep learning (DL) 
      algorithms on various medical image tasks have continually improved. DL 
      algorithms have been proposed as a tool to detect various forms of intracranial 
      hemorrhage on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the head. In subtle, 
      acute cases, the capacity for DL algorithm image interpretation support might 
      improve the diagnostic yield of CT for detection of this time-critical condition, 
      potentially expediting treatment where appropriate and improving patient 
      outcomes. However, there are multiple challenges to DL algorithm implementation, 
      such as the relative scarcity of labeled datasets, the difficulties in developing 
      algorithms capable of volumetric medical image analysis, and the complex 
      practicalities of deployment into clinical practice. This review examines the 
      literature and the approaches taken in the development of DL algorithms for the 
      detection of intracranial hemorrhage on NCCT head studies. Considerations in 
      crafting such algorithms will be discussed, as well as challenges which must be 
      overcome to ensure effective, dependable implementations as automated tools in a 
      clinical setting.

      contain a wealth of prognostic information. In this study, we developed a high 
      content image analysis (HCIA) workflow to quantify features of H&E images from 
      HPV + OpSCC patients to identify prognostic features and predict patient 
      outcomes. METHODS: First, we have developed an open-source HCIA tool for 
      single-cell segmentation and classification of H&E images. Subsequently, we have 
      used our HCIA tool to analyse a set of 889 images from diagnostic H&E slides in a 
      retrospective cohort of HPV + OpSCC patients with favourable (FO, n = 60) or 
      unfavourable (UO, n = 30) outcomes. We have identified and measured 31 prognostic 
      features which were quantified in each sample and used to train a neural network 
      (NN) model to predict patient outcomes. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate 
      statistical analyses revealed significant differences between FO and UO patients 
      in 31 and 17 variables, respectively (P < 0.05). At the single-image level, the 
      NN model had an overall accuracy of 72.5% and 71.2% in recognising FO and UO 
      patients when applied to test or validation sets, respectively. When considering 
      10 images per patient, the accuracy of the NN model increased to 86.7% in the 
      test set. CONCLUSION: Our open-source H&E analysis workflow and predictive models 
      confirm previously reported prognostic features and identifies novel factors 
      which predict HPV + OpSCC outcomes with promising accuracy. Our work supports the 
      use of machine learning in digital pathology to exploit clinically relevant 
      features in routine diagnostic pathology without additional biomarkers.

TI  - Improving Dental Implant Outcomes: CNN-Based System Accurately Measures Degree of 
      Peri-Implantitis Damage on Periapical Film.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering10060640 [doi]
LID - 640
AB  - As the popularity of dental implants continues to grow at a rate of about 14% per 
      year, so do the risks associated with the procedure. Complications such as 
      sinusitis and nerve damage are not uncommon, and inadequate cleaning can lead to 
      peri-implantitis around the implant, jeopardizing its stability and potentially 
      necessitating retreatment. To address this issue, this research proposes a new 
      system for evaluating the degree of periodontal damage around implants using 
      Periapical film (PA). The system utilizes two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
      models to accurately detect the location of the implant and assess the extent of 
      damage caused by peri-implantitis. One of the CNN models is designed to determine 
      the location of the implant in the PA with an accuracy of up to 89.31%, while the 
      other model is responsible for assessing the degree of Peri-implantitis damage 
      around the implant, achieving an accuracy of 90.45%. The system combines image 
      cropping based on position information obtained from the first CNN with image 
      enhancement techniques such as Histogram Equalization and Adaptive Histogram 
      Equalization (AHE) to improve the visibility of the implant and gums. The result 
      is a more accurate assessment of whether peri-implantitis has eroded to the first 
      thread, a critical indicator of implant stability. To ensure the ethical and 
      regulatory standards of our research, this proposal has been certified by the 
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) under number 202102023B0C503. With no existing 
      technology to evaluate Peri-implantitis damage around dental implants, this 
      CNN-based system has the potential to revolutionize implant dentistry and improve 
      patient outcomes.

TI  - Prognostic models for predicting clinical disease progression, worsening and 
      activity in people with multiple sclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the 
      central nervous system that affects millions of people worldwide. The disease 
      course varies greatly across individuals and many disease-modifying treatments 
      with different safety and efficacy profiles have been developed recently. 
      Prognostic models evaluated and shown to be valid in different settings have the 
      potential to support people with MS and their physicians during the 
      decision-making process for treatment or disease/life management, allow 
      stratified and more precise interpretation of interventional trials, and provide 
      insights into disease mechanisms. Many researchers have turned to prognostic 
      models to help predict clinical outcomes in people with MS; however, to our 
      knowledge, no widely accepted prognostic model for MS is being used in clinical 
      practice yet. OBJECTIVES: To identify and summarise multivariable prognostic 
      models, and their validation studies for quantifying the risk of clinical disease 
      progression, worsening, and activity in adults with MS. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 
      January 1996 until July 2021. We also screened the reference lists of included 
      studies and relevant reviews, and references citing the included studies. 
      SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all statistically developed multivariable 
      prognostic models aiming to predict clinical disease progression, worsening, and 
      activity, as measured by disability, relapse, conversion to definite MS, 
      conversion to progressive MS, or a composite of these in adult individuals with 
      MS. We also included any studies evaluating the performance of (i.e. validating) 
      these models. There were no restrictions based on language, data source, timing 
      of prognostication, or timing of outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of 
      review authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted 
      data using a piloted form based on the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data 
      Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS), 
      assessed risk of bias using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool 
      (PROBAST), and assessed reporting deficiencies based on the checklist items in 
      Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual 
      Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD). The characteristics of the included models and 
      their validations are described narratively. We planned to meta-analyse the 
      discrimination and calibration of models with at least three external validations 
      outside the model development study but no model met this criterion. We 
      summarised between-study heterogeneity narratively but again could not perform 
      the planned meta-regression. MAIN RESULTS: We included 57 studies, from which we 
      identified 75 model developments, 15 external validations corresponding to only 
      12 (16%) of the models, and six author-reported validations. Only two models were 
      externally validated multiple times. None of the identified external validations 
      were performed by researchers independent of those that developed the model. The 
      outcome was related to disease progression in 39 (41%), relapses in 8 (8%), 
      conversion to definite MS in 17 (18%), and conversion to progressive MS in 27 
      (28%) of the 96 models or validations. The disease and treatment-related 
      characteristics of included participants, and definitions of considered 
      predictors and outcome, were highly heterogeneous amongst the studies. Based on 
      the publication year, we observed an increase in the percent of participants on 
      treatment, diversification of the diagnostic criteria used, an increase in 
      consideration of biomarkers or treatment as predictors, and increased use of 
      machine learning methods over time. Usability and reproducibility All identified 
      models contained at least one predictor requiring the skills of a medical 
      specialist for measurement or assessment. Most of the models (44; 59%) contained 
      predictors that require specialist equipment likely to be absent from primary 
      care or standard hospital settings. Over half (52%) of the developed models were 
      not accompanied by model coefficients, tools, or instructions, which hinders 
      their application, independent validation or reproduction. The data used in model 
      developments were made publicly available or reported to be available on request 
      only in a few studies (two and six, respectively). Risk of bias We rated all but 
      one of the model developments or validations as having high overall risk of bias. 
      The main reason for this was the statistical methods used for the development or 
      evaluation of prognostic models; we rated all but two of the included model 
      developments or validations as having high risk of bias in the analysis domain. 
      None of the model developments that were externally validated or these models' 
      external validations had low risk of bias. There were concerns related to 
      applicability of the models to our research question in over one-third (38%) of 
      the models or their validations. Reporting deficiencies Reporting was poor 
      overall and there was no observable increase in the quality of reporting over 
      time. The items that were unclearly reported or not reported at all for most of 
      the included models or validations were related to sample size justification, 
      blinding of outcome assessors, details of the full model or how to obtain 
      predictions from it, amount of missing data, and treatments received by the 
      participants. Reporting of preferred model performance measures of discrimination 
      and calibration was suboptimal. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence is not 
      sufficient for recommending the use of any of the published prognostic prediction 
      models for people with MS in clinical routine today due to lack of independent 
      external validations. The MS prognostic research community should adhere to the 
      current reporting and methodological guidelines and conduct many more 
      state-of-the-art external validation studies for the existing or newly developed 
      models.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of a newly constructed 
      computer-based decision support system (DSS) on the basis of artificial 
      intelligence technology and designed to plan treatment for patients with a deep 
      overbite. METHODS: With the help of information technology, a DSS was developed 
      specifically for treatment planning of deepbite malocclusion. The program inputs 
      were the components and the contributing factors used commonly by the orthodontic 
      clinicians in deepbite diagnosis. The program outputs were the treatment planning 
      options for deepbite treatment. A total of 357 decisions made by the algorithm 
      were evaluated for accuracy by comparing them to the actual treatment changes of 
      51 patients with a well-treated deepbite. RESULTS: The decisions made by the 
      algorithm were precise, with 94.4% having a very good agreement with actual 
      treatment changes determined using Cohen's kappa coefficient. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      constructed DSS was shown to be an efficient tool for planning treatment of deep 
      overbite malocclusion in the permanent dentition; thus, the artificial 
      intelligence could be used to formulate a customized plan for orthodontic 
      clinicians.

AB  - The available reference data for the mandible and mandibular growth consists 
      primarily of two-dimensional linear or angular measurements. The aim of this 
      study was to create the first open-source, three-dimensional statistical shape 
      model of the mandible that spans the complete growth period. Computed tomography 
      scans of 678 mandibles from children and young adults between 0 and 22 years old 
      were included in the model. The mandibles were segmented using a semi-automatic 
      or automatic (artificial intelligence-based) segmentation method. Point 
      correspondence among the samples was achieved by rigid registration, followed by 
      non-rigid registration of a symmetrical template onto each sample. The 
      registration process was validated with adequate results. Principal component 
      analysis was used to gain insight in the variation within the dataset and to 
      investigate age-related changes and sexual dimorphism. The presented growth model 
      is accessible globally and free-of-charge for scientists, physicians and forensic 
      investigators for any kind of purpose deemed suitable. The versatility of the 
      model opens up new possibilities in the fields of oral and maxillofacial surgery, 
      forensic sciences or biological anthropology. In clinical settings, the model may 
      aid diagnostic decision-making, treatment planning and treatment evaluation.

TI  - Histologic assessments in ulcerative colitis: the evidence behind a new endpoint 
      in clinical trials.
PG  - 73-87
LID - 10.1080/17474124.2024.2326838 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment goals for ulcerative colitis (UC) are evolving from the 
      achievement of clinical remission to more rigorous goals defined by endoscopic 
      and histologic healing. Achievement of deeper remission targets aims to reduce 
      the risk of colectomy, hospitalizations, and colorectal cancer. AREAS COVERED: 
      This review covers histologic assessments, histologic remission as a clinical 
      trial endpoint, and the association between histologic disease activity and 
      clinical outcomes. Future directions are also discussed, including the use of 
      advanced imaging and artificial intelligence technologies, as well as potential 
      future treatment targets beyond histologic remission. EXPERT OPINION: Histologic 
      assessments are used for their sensitivity in measuring mucosal inflammatory 
      changes in UC. Due to correlation with disease activity, histologic assessments 
      may support clinical decision-making regarding treatment decisions as such 
      assessments can be associated with rates of clinical relapse, hospitalization, 
      colectomy, and neoplasia. While histologic remission is limited by varying 
      definitions and multiple histologic indices, work is ongoing to create a 
      consensus on the use of histologic assessments in clinical trials. As research 
      advances, aspirational targets beyond histologic remission, such as molecular 
      healing and disease clearance, are being explored.

OAB - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common inflammatory bowel disease and often 
      results in bloody diarrhea, frequent bowel movements, and bowel urgency. Patients 
      with UC are at greater risk for hospitalization, surgery, and colorectal cancer. 
      To reduce these risks, the goals of UC treatment are changing from mainly 
      addressing symptoms to reducing inflammation at a deeper histologic, or 
      microscopic, level. The inflammation in UC causes distinct microscopic changes in 
      the colon, which can be assessed after collecting biopsies or tissue samples. 
      This review provides an overview of histologic remission (when no signs of 
      inflammation are seen in tissue samples viewed under a microscope) as a treatment 
      goal in UC.Histologic remission has been shown to be associated with lower rates 
      of relapse, hospitalization, surgical removal of the colon, and colorectal 
      cancer. However, using histologic remission as a treatment target can be 
      difficult due to varying definitions and the many different scoring assessments 
      available to healthcare providers. Updated guidance from regulatory agencies and 
      academic organizations has helped align definitions of histologic remission and 
      how to assess histologic healing in clinical trials.The introduction of targeted 
      advanced therapies has allowed for deeper healing with the potential for 
      histologic resolution. This enables clinicians and researchers to aim for 
      treatment targets that are harder to achieve but have a greater impact for 
      patients in the course of their disease. New technologies such as artificial 
      intelligence, high-resolution endoscopy, and digital pathology have also led to 
      targets beyond histologic healing, aiming to restore the function of the colon’s 
      mucosal barrier and disease clearance.

TI  - Lateral Cephalometric Landmark Annotation Using Histogram Oriented Gradients 
      Extracted from Region of Interest Patches.
PG  - 806-812
LID - 10.1007/s12663-023-02025-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Two-dimensional cephalometric image analysis plays a crucial role 
      in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. While deep learning-based 
      algorithms have emerged to automate the laborious task of anatomical landmark 
      annotation, their effectiveness is hampered by the challenges of acquiring and 
      labelling clinical data. In this study, we propose a model that leverages 
      conventional machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of landmark 
      detection using limited dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our methodology involves 
      coarse localization through region of interest (ROI) extraction and fine 
      localization utilizing histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) feature. The image patch 
      containing landmark pixels is classified using the light gradient boosting 
      machine (LGBM) algorithm. To evaluate our model's performance, we conducted 
      rigorous tests on the ISBI Cephalometric dataset and Dental Cepha dataset, aiming 
      to achieve accuracy within a 2 mm radial precision range. We also employed 
      cross-validation to assess our approach, providing a robust evaluation. RESULTS: 
      Our model's performance on the ISBI Cephalometric dataset showed an accuracy rate 
      of 77.11% within the desired 2 mm radial precision range. The cross-validation 
      results further confirmed the effectiveness of our approach, yielding a mean 
      accuracy of 78.17%. Additionally, we applied our model to the Dental Cepha 
      dataset, where we achieved a remarkable landmark detection accuracy of 84%. 
      CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that traditional machine learning techniques 
      can be effective for accurate landmark detection in cephalometric images, even 
      with limited data. Our findings highlight the potential of these techniques for 
      clinical applications, where large datasets of labelled images may not be 
      available.

TI  - SURGICALLY ASSISTED RAPID MAXILLARY EXPANSION: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF 
      COMPLICATIONS 2012-2017.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - Surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME) is a common technique 
      developed to treat skeletally mature patients with transverse maxillary 
      deficiency. Although SARME is supposed to be a relatively safe procedure, it is 
      not completely free of complications. The purpose of this study was to reveal the 
      most typical postoperative SARME complications. Retrospective evaluation of the 
      clinical cases of 665 patients (247 males and 418 females, mean age 25,3 years) 
      with the diagnosis of maxillary transverse deficiency, who underwent SARME in 
      period between 2012 and 2017 at the Clinical Center of Maxillofacial, Plastic 
      Surgery and Dentistry, Moscow. According to the results of the research, the most 
      typical complications of SARME are paresthesia of the infraorbital nerve branches 
      and nasopalatine nerve (198/665), distraction device dislocation (61/665), 
      inflammation in the distraction device area (57/665), insufficient expansion of

TI  - The precision of case difficulty and referral decisions: an innovative automated 
      approach.
PG  - 1909-1915

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endodontic treatment works as a successful treatment modality in 
      several cases. However, it may fail due to some reasons unforeseeable by the 
      dentist. Many failures can be prevented by carefully assessing the difficulty 
      level of the case before initiating treatment or by referral to a specialist. 
      This study presents an approach using machine learning to generate an algorithm 
      which can help predict the difficulty level of the case and decide about a 
      referral, with the help of the standard American Association of Endodontists 
      (AAE) Endodontic Case Difficulty Assessment Form. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 
      the AAE Endodontic Case Difficulty Form after obtaining the patients' consent, 
      500 potential root canal patients were diagnosed. The filled forms were assessed 
      by two pre-calibrated endodontists, and, in cases of conflicting opinion, a third 
      endodontist's opinion was taken. Artificial neural network was used for 
      generating the algorithm. RESULTS: Using 500 filled AAE forms, a sensitivity of 
      94.96% was achieved by the machine learning algorithm. CONCLUSION: This study 
      provides an option for automation to the conventional method of predicting the 
      difficulty level of a case, thus increasing the speed of decision-making and 
      referrals if necessary. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An AAE Endodontic Case Difficulty 
      Assessment Form when utilized along with machine learning can assist general 
      dentists in rapid assessment of the case difficulty. This is a helpful tool in 
      developing countries, where endodontic treatment and referral guidelines are 
      often neglected. It also helps to make difficulty level assessments easier for 
      novice practitioners, when they are in doubt about the same.

TI  - The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Accurate Diagnosis and Treatment 
      Planning of Non-Syndromic Supernumerary Teeth: A Case Report in a Six-Year-Old 
      Boy.
LID - 10.3390/children10050839 [doi]
LID - 839
AB  - Hyperdontia can cause numerous aesthetic and functional problems. The diagnosis 
      is made radiologically, and the most commonly used radiological method is 
      orthopantomography, while CBCT is also used. CBCT has the advantage of being 
      three-dimensional. Artificial Intelligence is widely used in medicine and 
      dentistry, and it can create a specific algorithm to aid in diagnosis and suggest 
      therapeutic procedures. In a case report, a 6-year-old boy was diagnosed with a 
      supernumerary tooth between the upper central incisors. Orthopantomography 
      revealed another impacted supernumerary tooth, and the patient was referred for 
      CBCT. A platform for analyzing dental images, based on artificial intelligence, 
      Diagnocat (Diagnocat Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA), was used for analysis and the 
      AI system identified the supernumerary teeth and provided a complete plan for 
      treatment. The use of AI in dentistry allows for faster and more accurate 
      diagnosis and treatment planning.

TI  - Characterizing Motor Control of Mastication With Soft Actor-Critic.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2020.00188 [doi]
LID - 188
AB  - The human masticatory system is a complex functional unit characterized by a 
      multitude of skeletal components, muscles, soft tissues, and teeth. Muscle 
      activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to 
      ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle 
      activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of 
      research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is 
      inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics 
      of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a 
      well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are 
      trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex 
      actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known 
      as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated 
      masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its 
      desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric 
      neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate 
      the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of 
      motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis 
      platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the 
      functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses 
      the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of 
      activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We 
      demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by 
      integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the 
      inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their 
      agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL 
      training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other 
      biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the 
      functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the 
      rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects.

TI  - Evaluation of the accuracy of heart dose prediction by machine learning for 
      selecting patients not requiring deep inspiration breath‑hold radiotherapy after 
      breast cancer surgery.
PG  - 536
LID - 10.3892/etm.2023.12235 [doi]
LID - 536
AB  - Increased heart dose during postoperative radiotherapy (RT) for left-sided breast 
      cancer (BC) can cause cardiac injury, which can decrease patient survival. The 
      deep inspiration breath-hold technique (DIBH) is becoming increasingly common for 
      reducing the mean heart dose (MHD) in patients with left-sided BC. However, 
      treatment planning and DIBH for RT are laborious, time-consuming and costly for 
      patients and RT staff. In addition, the proportion of patients with left BC with 
      low MHD is considerably higher among Asian women, mainly due to their smaller 
      breast volume compared with that in Western countries. The present study aimed to 
      determine the optimal machine learning (ML) model for predicting the MHD after RT 
      to pre-select patients with low MHD who will not require DIBH prior to RT 
      planning. In total, 562 patients with BC who received postoperative RT were 
      randomly divided into the trainval (n=449) and external (n=113) test datasets for 
      ML using Python (version 3.8). Imbalanced data were corrected using synthetic 
      minority oversampling with Gaussian noise. Specifically, right-left, tumor site, 
      chest wall thickness, irradiation method, body mass index and separation were the 
      six explanatory variables used for ML, with four supervised ML algorithms used. 
      Using the optimal value of hyperparameter tuning with root mean squared error 
      (RMSE) as an indicator for the internal test data, the model yielding the best F2 
      score evaluation was selected for final validation using the external test data. 
      The predictive ability of MHD for true MHD after RT was the highest among all 
      algorithms for the deep neural network, with a RMSE of 77.4, F2 score of 0.80 and 
      area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic of 0.88, for a cut-off 
      value of 300 cGy. The present study suggested that ML can be used to pre-select 
      female Asian patients with low MHD who do not require DIBH for the postoperative 
      RT of BC.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess if long-term treatment costs in periodontitis patients 
      differ between stage III vs. IV and grade B vs. C according to the 2018 
      classification of periodontal diseases. METHODS: A cohort of 231 periodontitis 
      patients (followed over a mean of 18.4 years) was evaluated. Costs for active 
      periodontal therapy (APT, including scaling and root planning, open flap 
      debridement, root resections) and supportive periodontal therapy (SPT, including 
      also restorative, endodontic, prosthetic and surgical treatment) were estimated 
      from a mixed payer-perspective in Germany (in Euro 2020). Multi-dimensional 
      staging and grading was applied. The impact of stage, grade, sex and age on total 
      and annual costs was assessed. RESULTS: Mean (SD) total and annual treatment 
      costs were 7154 (2554) Euro and 437 (222) Euro. Costs were generated during SPT 
      (92 %) and by periodontal treatment (88 %) and decreased significantly with 
      longer follow-up (p < 0.001). Total costs were 7120 (2692) Euro in stage III (n = 
      154) vs. 7221 (2271) Euro in stage IV (n = 77; p > 0.05), and 6256 (1605) Euro in 
      grade B (n = 35) vs. 7314 (2660) Euro in grade C (n = 196; p < 0.001). Annual 
      costs were 426 (219) Euro vs. 459 (228) Euro for stage III vs. stage IV (p > 
      0.05) and 308 (163) Euro vs. 460 (224) Euro for grade B vs. grade C (p < 0.001). 
      Multivariable modelling found grade, but not stage, sex and age significantly 
      associated with costs. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, and in 
      patients with severe periodontitis who were systematically treated long-term, 
      grading, but not staging was associated with costs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Treatment costs were higher in patients with more progressive periodontitis and 
      were found to decrease during follow-up. Dentists need to consider costs during 
      treatment planning and communication with patients.

TI  - Identification of a Novel FAM83H Mutation and Management of Hypocalcified 
      Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Early Childhood.
LID - 10.3390/children9030429 [doi]
LID - 429
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders 
      affecting amelogenesis during dental development. Therefore, the molecular 
      genetic etiology of AI can provide information about the nature and progress of 
      the disease. To confirm the genetic etiology of AI in a Korean family with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance, pedigree and mutational analyses were performed. 
      DNA was isolated from the participating family members and whole-exome sequencing 
      was performed with the DNA sample of the father of the proband. The identified 
      mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mutational analysis revealed a 
      novel nonsense mutation in the FAM83H gene (NM_198488.5: c.1363C > T, 
      p.(Gln455*)), confirming autosomal dominant hypocalcified AI. Full-mouth 
      restorative treatments of the affected children were performed after the 
      completion of the deciduous dentition. Early diagnosis of AI can be useful for 
      understanding the nature of the disease and for managing the condition and 
      treatment planning.

TI  - Bedside tracking of functional autonomic age in preterm infants.
PG  - 206-212
LID - 10.1038/s41390-022-02376-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth predisposes infants to adverse outcomes that, without 
      early intervention, impacts their long-term health. To assist bedside monitoring, 
      we developed a tool to track the autonomic maturation of the preterm by assessing 
      heart rate variability (HRV) changes during intensive care. METHODS: 
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were longitudinally recorded in 67 infants 
      (26-38 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)). Supervised machine learning was used to 
      generate a functional autonomic age (FAA), by combining 50 computed HRV features 
      from successive 5-minute ECG epochs (median of 23 epochs per infant). Performance 
      of the FAA was assessed by correlation to PMA, clinical outcomes and the infant's 
      functional brain age (FBA), an index of maturation derived from the 
      electroencephalogram. RESULTS: The FAA was strongly correlated to PMA (r = 0.86, 
      95% CI: 0.83-0.93) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.66 weeks and also 
      accurately estimated FBA (MAE = 1.58 weeks, n = 54 infants). The relationship 
      between PMA and FAA was not confounded by neurodevelopmental outcome (p = 0.18, 
      n = 45), sex (p = 0.88, n = 56), patent ductus arteriosus (p = 0.08, n = 56), IVH 
      (p = 0.63, n = 56) or body weight at birth (p = 0.95, n = 56). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      FAA, an index derived from the ubiquitous ECG signal, offers direct avenues 
      towards estimating autonomic maturation at the bedside during intensive care 
      monitoring. IMPACT: The development of a tool to track functional autonomic age 
      in preterm infants based on heart rate variability features in the 
      electrocardiogram provides a rapid and specialized view of autonomic maturation 
      at the bedside. Functional autonomic age is linked closely to postmenstrual age 
      and central nervous system function response, as determined by its relationship 
      to functional brain age from the electroencephalogram. Tracking functional 
      autonomic age during neonatal intensive care unit monitoring offers a unique 
      insight into cardiovascular health in infants born extremely preterm and their 
      maturational trajectories to term age.

TI  - Tooth-Related Disease Detection System Based on Panoramic Images and Optimization 
      Through Automation: Development Study.
PG  - e38640
LID - 10.2196/38640 [doi]
LID - e38640
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of tooth-related diseases in patients plays a key 
      role in maintaining their dental health and preventing future complications. 
      Since dentists are not overly attentive to tooth-related diseases that may be 
      difficult to judge visually, many patients miss timely treatment. The 5 
      representative tooth-related diseases, that is, coronal caries or defect, 
      proximal caries, cervical caries or abrasion, periapical radiolucency, and 
      residual root can be detected on panoramic images. In this study, a web service 
      was constructed for the detection of these diseases on panoramic images in real 
      time, which helped shorten the treatment planning time and reduce the probability 
      of misdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE: This study designed a model to assess tooth-related 
      diseases in panoramic images by using artificial intelligence in real time. This 
      model can perform an auxiliary role in the diagnosis of tooth-related diseases by 
      dentists and reduce the treatment planning time spent through telemedicine. 
      METHODS: For learning the 5 tooth-related diseases, 10,000 panoramic images were 
      modeled: 4206 coronal caries or defects, 4478 proximal caries, 6920 cervical 
      caries or abrasion, 8290 periapical radiolucencies, and 1446 residual roots. To 
      learn the model, the fast region-based convolutional network (Fast R-CNN), 
      residual neural network (ResNet), and inception models were used. Learning about 
      the 5 tooth-related diseases completely did not provide accurate information on 
      the diseases because of indistinct features present in the panoramic pictures. 
      Therefore, 1 detection model was applied to each tooth-related disease, and the 
      models for each of the diseases were integrated to increase accuracy. RESULTS: 
      The Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy, with an accuracy of over 90%, 
      in diagnosing the 5 tooth-related diseases. Thus, Fast R-CNN was selected as the 
      final judgment model as it facilitated the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases 
      that are difficult to judge visually from radiographs and images, thereby 
      assisting the dentists in their treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: The Fast R-CNN 
      model showed the highest accuracy in the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases 
      and can therefore play an auxiliary role in shortening the treatment planning 
      time after the dentists diagnose the tooth-related disease. In addition, by 
      updating the captured panoramic images of patients on the web service developed 
      in this study, we are looking forward to increasing the accuracy of diagnosing 
      these 5 tooth-related diseases. The dental diagnosis system in this study takes 2 
      minutes for diagnosing 5 diseases in 1 panoramic image. Therefore, this system 
      plays an effective role in setting a dental treatment schedule.

TI  - Assessment of the quality of different commercial providers using artificial 
      intelligence for automated cephalometric analysis compared to human orthodontic 
      experts.
LID - 10.1007/s00056-023-00491-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of various 
      skeletal and dental cephalometric parameters as produced by different commercial 
      providers that make use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted automated 
      cephalometric analysis and to compare their quality to a gold standard 
      established by orthodontic experts. METHODS: Twelve experienced orthodontic 
      examiners pinpointed 15 radiographic landmarks on a total of 50 cephalometric 
      X‑rays. The landmarks were used to generate 9 parameters for orthodontic 
      treatment planning. The "humans' gold standard" was defined by calculating the 
      median value of all 12 human assessments for each parameter, which in turn served 
      as reference values for comparisons with results given by four different 
      commercial providers of automated cephalometric analyses (DentaliQ.ortho 
      [CellmatiQ GmbH, Hamburg, Germany], WebCeph [AssembleCircle Corp, Seongnam-si, 
      Korea], AudaxCeph [Audax d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia], CephX [Orca Dental AI, 
      Herzliya, Israel]). Repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were 
      calculated and Bland-Altman plots were generated for comparisons. RESULTS: The 
      results of the repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant differences between 
      the commercial providers' predictions and the humans' gold standard for all nine 
      investigated parameters. However, the pairwise comparisons also demonstrate that 
      there were major differences among the four commercial providers. While there 
      were no significant mean differences between the values of DentaliQ.ortho and the 
      humans' gold standard, the predictions of AudaxCeph showed significant deviations 
      in seven out of nine parameters. Also, the Bland-Altman plots demonstrate that 
      a reduced precision of AI predictions must be expected especially for values 
      attributed to the inclination of the incisors. CONCLUSION: Fully automated 
      cephalometric analyses are promising in terms of timesaving and avoidance of 
      individual human errors. At present, however, they should only be used under 
      supervision of experienced clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The proper estimate of the risk of recurrences in early-stage oral 
      tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is mandatory for individual 
      treatment-decision making. However, this remains a challenge even for experienced 
      multidisciplinary centers. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performance of four 
      machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the risk of locoregional 
      recurrences in patients with OTSCC. These algorithms were Support Vector Machine 
      (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), and Decision Forest (DF). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised 311 cases from the five 
      University Hospitals in Finland and A.C. Camargo Cancer Center, São Paulo, 
      Brazil. For comparison of the algorithms, we used the harmonic mean of precision 
      and recall called F1 score, specificity, and accuracy values. These algorithms 
      and their corresponding permutation feature importance (PFI) with the input 
      parameters were externally tested on 59 new cases. Furthermore, we compared the 
      performance of the algorithm that showed the highest prediction accuracy with the 
      prognostic significance of depth of invasion (DOI). RESULTS: The results showed 
      that the average specificity of all the algorithms was 71% . The SVM showed an 
      accuracy of 68% and F1 score of 0.63, NB an accuracy of 70% and F1 score of 0.64, 
      BDT an accuracy of 81% and F1 score of 0.78, and DF an accuracy of 78% and F1 
      score of 0.70. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based 
      approach, which gave an accuracy of 63%. With PFI-analysis, there was no 
      significant difference in the overall accuracies of three of the algorithms; 
      PFI-BDT accuracy increased to 83.1%, PFI-DF increased to 80%, PFI-SVM decreased 
      to 64.4%, while PFI-NB accuracy increased significantly to 81.4%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings show that the best classification accuracy was achieved with the 
      boosted decision tree algorithm. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the 
      DOI-based approach. Furthermore, with few parameters identified in the PFI 
      analysis, ML technique still showed the ability to predict locoregional 
      recurrence. The application of boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm 
      can stratify OTSCC patients and thus aid in their individual treatment planning.

TI  - Efficient high cone-angle artifact reduction in circular cone-beam CT using deep 
      learning with geometry-aware dimension reduction.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ac09a1 [doi]
AB  - High cone-angle artifacts (HCAAs) appear frequently in circular cone-beam 
      computed tomography (CBCT) images and can heavily affect diagnosis and treatment 
      planning. To reduce HCAAs in CBCT scans, we propose a novel deep learning 
      approach that reduces the three-dimensional (3D) nature of HCAAs to 
      two-dimensional (2D) problems in an efficient way. Specifically, we exploit the 
      relationship between HCAAs and the rotational scanning geometry by training a 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) using image slices that were radially sampled 
      from CBCT scans. We evaluated this novel approach using a dataset of input CBCT 
      scans affected by HCAAs and high-quality artifact-free target CBCT scans. Two 
      different CNN architectures were employed, namely U-Net and a mixed-scale dense 
      CNN (MS-D Net). The artifact reduction performance of the proposed approach was 
      compared to that of a Cartesian slice-based artifact reduction deep learning 
      approach in which a CNN was trained to remove the HCAAs from Cartesian slices. In 
      addition, all processed CBCT scans were segmented to investigate the impact of 
      HCAAs reduction on the quality of CBCT image segmentation. We demonstrate that 
      the proposed deep learning approach with geometry-aware dimension reduction 
      greatly reduces HCAAs in CBCT scans and outperforms the Cartesian slice-based 
      deep learning approach. Moreover, the proposed artifact reduction approach 
      markedly improves the accuracy of the subsequent segmentation task compared to 
      the Cartesian slice-based workflow.

AB  - PURPOSE: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides noninvasive 
      visualization of eloquent brain areas. The nTMS is usually applied in presurgical 
      planning to minimize the risk of surgery-related neurological deterioration. The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of nTMS data for GammaKnife 
      treatment planning for patients suffering from brain metastases. METHODS: Motor 
      cortex mapping with nTMS was performed in eight patients with brain metastases 
      within or adjacent to the precentral gyrus. The nTMS data set was imported into 
      the planning software and fused with anatomical MRI. Then contouring of the 
      target and critical structures was performed. Treatment plans with and without 
      visualization of the functional structures by nTMS were analyzed and compared by 
      neurosurgeon and medical physicist. RESULTS: The primary motor cortex was 
      successfully delineated even in all cases despite significant peritumoral edema. 
      Beam shaping and combined isocenters were used for conformal dose distribution 
      and steeper dose fall-off near the identified eloquent zone. Compared with plans 
      without nTMS data, treatment plans with integration of cortical nTMS mapping data 
      showed a 2% to 78% (mean, 35.2% ± 22.7%) lower 12-Gy volume within the motor 
      cortex without reduction of the dose applied to the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presented approach allows the easy and reliable integration of neurophysiological 
      mapping data into GammaKnife treatment plans by the standard GammaPlan software. 
      Diminishing the dose to critical structures might help to minimize side effects 
      and therefore improve quality of life for brain metastasis patients.

TI  - Diagnosis of Breakthrough Fungal Infections in the Clinical Mycology Laboratory: 
      An ECMM Consensus Statement.
LID - 10.3390/jof6040216 [doi]
LID - 216
AB  - Breakthrough invasive fungal infections (bIFI) cause significant morbidity and 
      mortality. Their diagnosis can be challenging due to reduced sensitivity to 
      conventional culture techniques, serologic tests, and PCR-based assays in 
      patients undergoing antifungal therapy, and their diagnosis can be delayed 
      contributing to poor patient outcomes. In this review, we provide consensus 
      recommendations on behalf of the European Confederation for Medical Mycology 
      (ECMM) for the diagnosis of bIFI caused by invasive yeasts, molds, and endemic 
      mycoses, to guide diagnostic efforts in patients receiving antifungals and 
      support the design of future clinical trials in the field of clinical mycology. 
      The cornerstone of lab-based diagnosis of breakthrough infections for yeast and 
      endemic mycoses remain conventional culture, to accurately identify the causative 
      pathogen and allow for antifungal susceptibility testing. The impact of 
      non-culture-based methods are not well-studied for the definite diagnosis of 
      breakthrough invasive yeast infections. Non-culture-based methods have an 
      important role for the diagnosis of breakthrough invasive mold infections, in 
      particular invasive aspergillosis, and a combination of testing involving 
      conventional culture, antigen-based assays, and PCR-based assays should be 
      considered. Multiple diagnostic modalities, including histopathology, culture, 
      antibody, and/or antigen tests and occasionally PCR-based assays may be required 
      to diagnose breakthrough endemic mycoses. A need exists for diagnostic tests that 
      are effective, simple, cheap, and rapid to enable the diagnosis of bIFI in 
      patients taking antifungals.

AB  - The digital workflow process follows different steps for all dental specialties. 
      However, the main ingredient for the diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up 
      workflow recipes is the imaging chain. The steps in the imaging chain usually 
      include all or at least some of the following modalities: cone-beam computed 
      tomographic data acquisition, segmentation of the cone-beam computed tomography 
      image, intraoral scanning, facial three-dimensional soft tissue capture and 
      superimposition of all the images for the creation of a virtual augmented model. 
      As a relevant clinical problem, the accumulation of error at each step of the 
      chain might negatively influence the final outcome. For an efficient digital 
      workflow, it is important to be aware of the existing challenges within the 
      imaging chain. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based strategies need to be 
      integrated in the future to make the workflow more simplified, accurate and 
      efficient.

TI  - Multifunctional anatomical prototypes (MAPs): Treatment of excessive gingival 
      display due to altered passive eruption.
PG  - 1058-1067
LID - 10.1111/jerd.13041 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a strategy using digital technologies for improving the 
      diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical execution of patients with excessive 
      gingival display (EGD) due to altered passive eruption (APE). CLINICAL 
      CONSIDERATIONS: An important component for successful patient's management is to 
      fulfill their esthetic expectations whilst delivering predictable and long-term 
      therapeutic outcomes. To achieve this goal in patients with excessive gingival 
      display due to altered passive eruption, it is essential to perform an accurate 
      diagnosis and to communicate to the patient the expected customized results using 
      digital technologies. Computer-aided designed and manufactured multifunctional 
      anatomical prototypes (MAPs) may contribute to these purposes. Additionally, they 
      can guide the surgical crown lengthening procedure or serve as a reference during 
      the surgical guide fabrication providing information of the required anatomical 
      landmarks. CONCLUSIONS: This novel strategy protocol for diagnosis, 
      communication, and treatment management of patients with excessive gingival 
      display follows functional and biological principles within the frame of a 
      digital workflow, which improves the diagnostic capabilities, enhances 
      communication, and guides the surgical treatment as shown in the 12 months 
      follow-up of the reported case. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Developing a virtual 
      patient by combining multiple digital data sets including cone-beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT), intra-oral scans and digital photography, supports the 
      clinician and the patient to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis and to better 
      communicate the expected results to the patient. Furthermore, this digital 
      treatment exercise based on anatomical and biological principles will facilitate 
      the surgical precision and the achievement of successful outcomes, thus 
      fulfilling the patient needs and expectations.

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of First-Line Pembrolizumab in Older Adults with PD-L1 
      Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study of the Alberta 
      Immunotherapy Database.
PG  - 4213-4222
LID - 10.3390/curroncol28050357 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of immunotherapy revolutionized the treatment of 
      non-small-cell-lung cancer (NSCLC), with multiple landmark clinical trials 
      establishing the efficacy of these agents. However, many patients who receive 
      immunotherapy in clinical practice would be considered clinical trial ineligible. 
      One such population that is often under-represented in clinical trials is older 
      adults. In the current study, we evaluated clinical and safety outcomes in this 
      population. Overall, older adults (>70 years of age) and younger adults had 
      comparable clinical outcomes with an equivalent objective response rate (ORR), 
      time to treatment failure (TTF), and median overall survival (p = 0.67, p = 0.98, 
      and p = 0.91, respectively). Furthermore, the safety outcomes were equivalent 
      between the cohorts with similar rates of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), 
      irAE-related hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalization (p = 0.99, p = 0.63, 
      and p = 0.74, respectively). While older age was not found to impact overall 
      survival, multivariant analysis revealed that a poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group (ECOG) status, low body-mass-index (BMI), and poor/intermediate lung immune 
      prognostic index (LIPI) were all associated with worse survival. In conclusion, 
      age does not impact the efficacy or safety of pembrolizumab in NSCLC, and 
      therefore advanced age should not be a deterrent for treating these patients with 
      pembrolizumab. Physicians and care providers can thus focus on other factors that 
      may influence therapeutic outcomes.

LID - 10.1038/s41415-024-7184-3 [doi]
AB  - Aim The present study aimed to explore the perceptions of dental students 
      regarding the ethical considerations associated with the use of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) algorithms in clinical decision-making.Methods All the 
      undergraduate clinical-year dental students were invited to take part in the 
      study. A validated online questionnaire which consisted of 21 closed-ended 
      questions (five-point Likert scales) was distributed to the students to evaluate 
      their perceptions on the topic. Mean perception scores of the students from 
      different years were analysed using a one-way ANOVA test, while independent 
      t-tests were used to compare the scores between sexes.Results In total, 165 
      students participated in the present study. The mean age of the respondents was 
      23.3 (± 1.38) years and the majority were female, Chinese students. Respondents 
      showed positive perceptions throughout all three domains. Uniform and comparable 
      perceptions were seen across various academic years and sexes, with female 
      respondents expressing stronger agreement regarding patient consent and privacy 
      prioritisation.Conclusion Undergraduate clinical dental students generally showed 
      positive perceptions regarding the ethical considerations associated with the 
      integration of AI algorithms in clinical decision-making. It is essential to 
      address these ethical considerations to ensure that AI benefits patient outcomes 
      while upholding fundamental ethical principles and patient-centred care.

AB  - Enlargement of the mandibular canal is a rare radiological finding. Clinically, 
      it may or may not be associated with sensory deficits. We report four cases of 
      widening of the mandibular canal observed with various methods of imaging with 
      different clinical characteristics. We describe this unique radiological finding 
      and elaborate the importance of quality assessment of the imaging that is vital 
      for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Clinicians should be mindful when 
      assessing the imaging whenever the size of the mandibular canal is implicated. 
      The case ranged from a benign tumor to malignancy, radiological errors, and 
      artifacts. A more superior imaging or treatment modality was necessary to 
      ascertain the diagnosis.

TI  - Automatic dental age calculation from panoramic radiographs using deep learning: 
      a two-stage approach with object detection and image classification.
PG  - 143
LID - 10.1186/s12903-024-03928-0 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental age is crucial for treatment planning in pediatric and 
      orthodontic dentistry. Dental age calculation methods can be categorized into 
      morphological, biochemical, and radiological methods. Radiological methods are 
      commonly used because they are non-invasive and reproducible. When radiographs 
      are available, dental age can be calculated by evaluating the developmental stage 
      of permanent teeth and converting it into an estimated age using a table, or by 
      measuring the length between some landmarks such as the tooth, root, or pulp, and 
      substituting them into regression formulas. However, these methods heavily depend 
      on manual time-consuming processes. In this study, we proposed a novel and 
      completely automatic dental age calculation method using panoramic radiographs 
      and deep learning techniques. METHODS: Overall, 8,023 panoramic radiographs were 
      used as training data for Scaled-YOLOv4 to detect dental germs and mean average 
      precision were evaluated. In total, 18,485 single-root and 16,313 multi-root 
      dental germ images were used as training data for EfficientNetV2 M to classify 
      the developmental stages of detected dental germs and Top-3 accuracy 
      was evaluated since the adjacent stages of the dental germ looks similar and the 
      many variations of the morphological structure can be observed between 
      developmental stages. Scaled-YOLOv4 and EfficientNetV2 M were trained using 
      cross-validation. We evaluated a single selection, a weighted average, and an 
      expected value to convert the probability of developmental stage classification 
      to dental age. One hundred and fifty-seven panoramic radiographs were used to 
      compare automatic and manual human experts' dental age calculations. RESULTS: 
      Dental germ detection was achieved with a mean average precision of 98.26% and 
      dental germ classifiers for single and multi-root were achieved with a Top-3 
      accuracy of 98.46% and 98.36%, respectively. The mean absolute errors between the 
      automatic and manual dental age calculations using single selection, weighted 
      average, and expected value were 0.274, 0.261, and 0.396, respectively. The 
      weighted average was better than the other methods and was accurate by less than 
      one developmental stage error. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the feasibility 
      of automatic dental age calculation using panoramic radiographs and a two-stage 
      deep learning approach with a clinically acceptable level of accuracy.

TI  - Systematic review and longitudinal analysis of implementing Artificial 
      Intelligence to predict clinical deterioration in adult hospitals: what is known 
      and what remains uncertain.
PG  - 509-524
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocad220 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors influencing implementation of machine learning 
      algorithms (MLAs) that predict clinical deterioration in hospitalized adult 
      patients and relate these to a validated implementation framework. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A systematic review of studies of implemented or trialed real-time 
      clinical deterioration prediction MLAs was undertaken, which identified: how MLA 
      implementation was measured; impact of MLAs on clinical processes and patient 
      outcomes; and barriers, enablers and uncertainties within the implementation 
      process. Review findings were then mapped to the SALIENT end-to-end 
      implementation framework to identify the implementation stages at which these 
      factors applied. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles relating to 14 groups of MLAs 
      were identified, each trialing or implementing a bespoke algorithm. One hundred 
      and seven distinct implementation evaluation metrics were identified. Four groups 
      reported decreased hospital mortality, 1 significantly. We identified 24 
      barriers, 40 enablers, and 14 uncertainties and mapped these to the 5 stages of 
      the SALIENT implementation framework. DISCUSSION: Algorithm performance across 
      implementation stages decreased between in silico and trial stages. Silent plus 
      pilot trial inclusion was associated with decreased mortality, as was the use of 
      logistic regression algorithms that used less than 39 variables. Mitigation of 
      alert fatigue via alert suppression and threshold configuration was commonly 
      employed across groups. CONCLUSIONS: : There is evidence that real-world 
      implementation of clinical deterioration prediction MLAs may improve clinical 
      outcomes. Various factors identified as influencing success or failure of 
      implementation can be mapped to different stages of implementation, thereby 
      providing useful and practical guidance for implementers.

AB  - The simplified preoperative planning of multiprobe prostate cryoablation limits 
      its efficiency. In order to improve it, the thermal history prediction software 
      is being developed. However, the problem of high risks at the prostate-urethra 
      boundary has not been solved yet. The urethral warming system is used to protect 
      the urethral canal from freezing. On the one hand it is used to reduce the risk 
      of damage to the urethra; on the other hand it increases the risk of insufficient 
      ablation of the tumor. This paper presents a step towards the possibility of 
      carrying out the precision prostate cryoablation in this region. For the 
      experimental part, three cases of arrangement of one and two argon cryoprobes and 
      a heating catheter have been considered. Freezing zone shape and dimensions, and 
      temperature at control points depending on time have been obtained. Experimental 
      results have clearly shown the effect of the heating catheter, the second 
      cryoprobe, and the initial temperature of the biotissue phantom on the freezing 
      zone. After, the thermal aspects of treatment simulation have been developed and 
      verified. A series of calculations have been carried out with the goal to get the 
      information about optimizing the prostate cryoablation on the prostate-urethra 
      boundary. The arrangement of cryoprobes has been proposed for three different 
      variants for prostate cryoablation (sectors of 90, 180° and 360°). The area of 
      prostate tissues near the urethra that cannot be cooled below the necrosis 
      temperature is shown. This information is expected to be useful for improving the 
      quality of cryosurgery planning algorithms (e.g. for tumor treatment).

TI  - CMF-Net: craniomaxillofacial landmark localization on CBCT images using geometric 
      constraint and transformer.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/acb483 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and robust anatomical landmark localization is a mandatory and crucial 
      step in deformation diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with 
      craniomaxillofacial (CMF) malformations. In this paper, we propose a trainable 
      end-to-end cephalometric landmark localization framework on Cone-beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) scans, referred to as CMF-Net, which combines the appearance 
      with transformers, geometric constraint, and adaptive wing (AWing) loss. More 
      precisely: (1) we decompose the localization task into two branches: the 
      appearance branch integrates transformers for identifying the exact positions of 
      candidates, while the geometric constraint branch at low resolution allows the 
      implicit spatial relationships to be effectively learned on the reduced training 
      data. (2) We use the AWing loss to leverage the difference between the pixel 
      values of the target heatmaps and the automatic prediction heatmaps. We verify 
      our CMF-Net by identifying the 24 most relevant clinical landmarks on 150 dental 
      CBCT scans with complicated scenarios collected from real-world clinics. 
      Comprehensive experiments show that it performs better than the state-of-the-art 
      deep learning methods, with an average localization error of 1.108 mm (the 
      clinically acceptable precision range being 1.5 mm) and a correct landmark 
      detection rate equal to 79.28%. Our CMF-Net is time-efficient and able to locate 
      skull landmarks with high accuracy and significant robustness. This approach 
      could be applied in 3D cephalometric measurement, analysis, and surgical 
      planning.

TI  - Coarse-to-fine prior-guided attention network for multi-structure segmentation on 
      dental panoramic radiographs.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6560/ad0218 [doi]
AB  - Objective. Accurate segmentation of various anatomical structures from dental 
      panoramic radiographs is essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of 
      various diseases in digital dentistry. In this paper, we propose a novel deep 
      learning-based method for accurate and fully automatic segmentation of the 
      maxillary sinus, mandibular condyle, mandibular nerve, alveolar bone and teeth on 
      panoramic radiographs.Approach. A two-stage coarse-to-fine prior-guided 
      segmentation framework is proposed to segment multiple structures on dental 
      panoramic radiographs. In the coarse stage, a multi-label segmentation network is 
      used to generate the coarse segmentation mask, and in the fine-tuning stage, a 
      prior-guided attention network with an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed 
      to precisely predict the mask of each anatomical structure. First, a prior-guided 
      edge fusion module is incorporated into the network at the input of each 
      convolution level of the encode path to generate edge-enhanced image feature 
      maps. Second, a prior-guided spatial attention module is proposed to guide the 
      network to extract relevant spatial features from foreground regions based on the 
      combination of the prior information and the spatial attention mechanism. 
      Finally, a prior-guided hybrid attention module is integrated at the bottleneck 
      of the network to explore global context from both spatial and category 
      perspectives.Main results. We evaluated the segmentation performance of our 
      method on a testing dataset that contains 150 panoramic radiographs collected 
      from real-world clinical scenarios. The segmentation results indicate that our 
      proposed method achieves more accurate segmentation performance compared with 
      state-of-the-art methods. The average Jaccard scores are 87.91%, 85.25%, 63.94%, 
      93.46% and 88.96% for the maxillary sinus, mandibular condyle, mandibular nerve, 
      alveolar bone and teeth, respectively.Significance. The proposed method was able 
      to accurately segment multiple structures on panoramic radiographs. This method 
      has the potential to be part of the process of automatic pathology diagnosis from 
      dental panoramic radiographs.

TI  - Three-dimensional maxillary virtual patient creation by convolutional neural 
      network-based segmentation on cone-beam computed tomography images.
PG  - 1133-1141
LID - 10.1007/s00784-022-04708-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively and quantitatively assess integrated segmentation of 
      three convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the creation of a maxillary 
      virtual patient (MVP) from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A dataset of 40 CBCT scans acquired with different scanning 
      parameters was selected. Three previously validated individual CNN models were 
      integrated to achieve a combined segmentation of maxillary complex, maxillary 
      sinuses, and upper dentition. Two experts performed a qualitative assessment, 
      scoring-integrated segmentations from 0 to 10 based on the number of required 
      refinements. Furthermore, experts executed refinements, allowing performance 
      comparison between integrated automated segmentation (AS) and refined 
      segmentation (RS) models. Inter-observer consistency of the refinements and the 
      time needed to create a full-resolution automatic segmentation were calculated. 
      RESULTS: From the dataset, 85% scored 7-10, and 15% were within 3-6. The average 
      time required for automated segmentation was 1.7 min. Performance metrics 
      indicated an excellent overlap between automatic and refined segmentation with a 
      dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 99.3%. High inter-observer consistency of 
      refinements was observed, with a 95% Hausdorff distance (HD) of 0.045 mm. 
      CONCLUSION: The integrated CNN models proved to be fast, accurate, and consistent 
      along with a strong interobserver consistency in creating the MVP. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: The automated segmentation of these structures simultaneously could 
      act as a valuable tool in clinical orthodontics, implant rehabilitation, and any 
      oral or maxillofacial surgical procedures, where visualization of MVP and its 
      relationship with surrounding structures is a necessity for reaching an accurate 
      diagnosis and patient-specific treatment planning.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Artificial Intelligence and Manual Methods for 
      Three-Dimensional Anatomical Landmark Identification in Dentofacial Treatment 
      Planning.
LID - 10.3390/bioengineering11040318 [doi]
LID - 318
AB  - With the growing demand for orthognathic surgery and other facial treatments, the 
      accurate identification of anatomical landmarks has become crucial. Recent 
      advancements have shifted towards using three-dimensional radiologic analysis 
      instead of traditional two-dimensional methods, as it allows for more precise 
      treatment planning, primarily relying on direct identification by clinicians. 
      However, manual tracing can be time-consuming, mainly when dealing with a large 
      number of patients. This study compared the accuracy and reliability of 
      identifying anatomical landmarks using artificial intelligence (AI) and manual 
      identification. Thirty patients over 19 years old who underwent pre-orthodontic 
      and orthognathic surgery treatment and had pre-orthodontic three-dimensional 
      radiologic scans were selected. Thirteen anatomical indicators were identified 
      using both AI and manual methods. The landmarks were identified by AI and four 
      experienced clinicians, and multiple ANOVA was performed to analyze the results. 
      The study results revealed minimal significant differences between AI and manual 
      tracing, with a maximum deviation of less than 2.83 mm. This indicates that 
      utilizing AI to identify anatomical landmarks can be a reliable method in 
      planning orthognathic surgery. Our findings suggest that using AI for anatomical 
      landmark identification can enhance treatment accuracy and reliability, 
      ultimately benefiting clinicians and patients.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a considerable focus on developing effective 
      methods for monitoring health care processes. Utilizing Statistical Process 
      Monitoring (SPM) approaches, particularly risk-adjusted control charts, has 
      emerged as a highly promising approach for achieving robust frameworks for this 
      aim. Considering risk-adjusted control charts, longitudinal health care process 
      data is typically monitored by establishing a regression relationship between 
      various risk factors (explanatory variables) and patient outcomes (response 
      variables). While the majority of prior research has primarily employed logistic 
      models in risk-adjusted control charts, there are more intricate health care 
      processes that necessitate the incorporation of both parametric and nonparametric 
      risk factors. In such scenarios, the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) proves to 
      be a suitable choice, albeit it often introduces higher computational complexity 
      and associated challenges. Surprisingly, there are limited instances where 
      researchers have proposed advancements in this direction. The primary objective 
      of this paper is to introduce an SPM framework for monitoring health care 
      processes using a GAM over time, coupled with a novel risk-adjusted control chart 
      driven by machine learning techniques. This control chart is implemented on a 
      data set encompassing two stroke types: ischemic and hemorrhagic. The key focus 
      of this study is to monitor the stability of the relationship between stroke 
      types and predefined explanatory variables over time within this data set. 
      Extensive simulation results, based on real data from patients with acute stroke, 
      demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of the proposed method in terms of its 
      detection capabilities compared to conventional approaches.

PG  - 17-18
LID - 10.1038/s41432-023-00865-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To collect evidence on the ability of artificial intelligence programs 
      to accurately make extraction decisions in orthodontic treatment planning. DATA 
      SOURCES: Authors electronically searched the following databases: PubMed/ 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, LIVIVO, Computers & Applied 
      Science, ACM Digital Library, and Compendex, Open Grey, Google Scholar, and 
      ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis. STUDY SELECTION: Three independent reviewers 
      collected the following data: number of cases of extraction and non-extraction, 
      number of experts in orthodontics and their years of experience, number of 
      variables used in the index model test, type of artificial intelligence and 
      algorithms, accuracy outcomes, the three highest variable ranks weighted in the 
      computational model, and the main conclusion. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Risk 
      of bias was assessed using Quadas 2 checklist for AI, and certainty of evidence 
      was evaluated by GRADE. RESULTS: After 2 phases of screening by 3 independent 
      reviewers, 6 studies met the inclusion criteria for the final review. The AI 
      programs used by the included studies were as follows: ensemble learning/random 
      forest, artificial neural network/multilayer perceptron, machine learning/back 
      propagation and machine learning/feature vectors. All studies showed an unclear 
      risk of bias for patient selection. Two studies had high risk of bias in the 
      index test, while two others presented an unclear risk of bias in the diagnostic 
      test. Meta-analysis of the pooled data resulted in 0.87 accuracy value for all 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that AI's ability to predict 
      extractions is promising but should be interpreted with caution.

      Diagnostic Accuracy.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13092709 [doi]
LID - 2709
AB  - Background/Objectives: Periapical lesions (PLs) are frequently detected in dental 
      radiology. Accurate diagnosis of these lesions is essential for proper treatment 
      planning. Imaging techniques such as orthopantomogram (OPG) and cone-beam CT 
      (CBCT) imaging are used to identify PLs. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) software Diagnocat for PL 
      detection in OPG and CBCT images. Methods: The study included 49 patients, 
      totaling 1223 teeth. Both OPG and CBCT images were analyzed by AI software and by 
      three experienced clinicians. All the images were obtained in one patient cohort, 
      and findings were compared to the consensus of human readers using CBCT. The AI's 
      diagnostic accuracy was compared to a reference method, calculating sensitivity, 
      specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value 
      (NPV), and F1 score. Results: The AI's sensitivity for OPG images was 33.33% with 
      an F1 score of 32.73%. For CBCT images, the AI's sensitivity was 77.78% with an 
      F1 score of 84.00%. The AI's specificity was over 98% for both OPG and CBCT 
      images. Conclusions: The AI demonstrated high sensitivity and high specificity in 
      detecting PLs in CBCT images but lower sensitivity in OPG images.

      Features.
PG  - e56682
LID - 10.7759/cureus.56682 [doi]
LID - e56682
AB  - Background Early screening and diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) 
      has always been a major challenge for pathologists. Artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-assisted screening tools can serve as an adjunct for the objective 
      interpretation of Papanicolaou (PAP)-stained oral smears. Aim This study aimed to 
      develop a handy and sensitive computer-assisted AI tool based on color-intensity 
      textural features to be applied to cytologic images for screening and diagnosis 
      of OSCC. Methodology The study included two groups consisting of 80 OSCC subjects 
      and 80 control groups. PAP-stained smears were collected from both groups. The 
      smears were analyzed in Matlab software computed data and color intensity-based 
      textural features such as entropy, contrast, energy, homogeneity, and 
      correlation, were quantitatively extracted. Results In this study, a 
      statistically significant difference was noted for entropy, energy, correlation, 
      contrast, and homogeneity. It was found that entropy and contrast were found to 
      be higher with a decrease in homogeneity, correlation, and energy in OSCC when 
      compared to the control group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis 
      was done and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were found to be 88%, 91%, 
      and 81%, respectively. Conclusion The gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) 
      color intensity-based textural features play a significant role in 
      differentiating dysplastic and normal cells in the diagnosis of OSCC. 
      Computer-aided textural analysis has the potential to aid in the early detection 
      of oral cancer, which can lead to improved clinical outcomes.

TI  - Disulfidptosis in head and neck squamous carcinoma: Integrative bioinformatic and 
      in-vitro analysis.
LID - 10.1111/odi.14977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) is a prevalent global 
      malignancy with limited treatment options, which necessitates the development of 
      novel therapeutic strategies. Disulfidptosis, a recently discovered and unique 
      cell death pathway, may offer promise as a treatment target in HNSC. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We identified disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) using multiple 
      algorithms and developed a prognostic model based on a disulfidptosis-related 
      gene index (DRGI). The model's predictive accuracy was assessed by ROC-AUC, and 
      patients were stratified by risk scores. We investigated the tumor immune 
      microenvironment, immune responses, tumorigenesis pathways, and chemotherapy 
      sensitivity (IC50). We also constructed a diagnostic model using 20 
      machine-learning algorithms and validated PCBP2 expression through RT-qPCR and 
      western blot. RESULTS: We developed a 12-DRG DRGI prognostic model, classifying 
      patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group experiencing 
      poorer clinical outcomes. Notable differences in tumor immune microenvironment 
      and chemosensitivity were observed, with reduced immune activity and suboptimal 
      treatment responses in the high-risk group. Advanced machine learning and 
      in-vitro experiments supported DRGI's potential as a reliable HNSC diagnostic 
      biomarker. CONCLUSION: We established a novel DRGI-based prognostic and 
      diagnostic model for HNSC, exploring its tumor immune microenvironment 
      implications, and offering valuable insights for future research and clinical 
      trials.

TI  - Efficacy of Complex Phytoadaptogens as an Adjunct to Non-surgical Treatment of 
      Chronic Periodontitis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 348-356
LID - 10.4103/jispcd.JISPCD_56_21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many herbal formulas are used in dentistry in the complex treatment 
      and prevention of periodontitis, but it is not always possible to achieve a 
      long-term remission and stimulate regeneration of periodontal structures. AIM: 
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of 
      chronotherapy with complex phytoadaptogens (CFA) as an adjunct to non-surgical 
      periodontal treatment (NSPT) and to achieve long-term remission. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Forty systemically healthy patients with chronic generalized 
      periodontitis (probing pocket depth ≥5 mm) were randomly divided into two groups: 
      patients in one group received treatment with NSPT alone (group 2), whereas 
      patients in another group received CFA in addition to NSPT (group 3). Twenty 
      individuals with healthy periodontium (group 1) composed a control group. The 
      clinical outcomes, Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), Sulcus Bleeding Index 
      (SBI), Periodontal Index (PI), and Doppler ultrasound results, were assessed on 
      baseline, after treatment, and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: There was a 
      statistically significant difference between groups 2 and 3, in favor of group 3 
      in terms of microcirculation parameters-S (P = 0.03), M (P = 0.02), D (P = 0.03), 
      and RI (P = 0.005); indicators of PI (P = 0.005), SBI (P = 0.03), and OHI-S (P = 
      0.006) were closer to the normal values during 6-month follow-up. Also there was 
      a statistical difference (P < 0.05) at all time points compared with controls, 
      for several parameters in intragroup comparison. CONCLUSION: The data obtained 
      confirm the hypothesis that CFA application in chronic periodontitis treatment is 
      more than appropriate for long-term prevention due to their immunomodulatory, 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, stress-limiting, chronotropic effects.

AB  - This review addresses the complexities of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and its 
      associated complications, with a particular focus on diabetic retinopathy (DR). 
      This review outlines the progression from non-proliferative to proliferative 
      diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema, highlighting the role of 
      dysglycemia in the pathogenesis of these conditions. A significant portion of 
      this review is devoted to technological advances in diabetes management, 
      particularly the use of hybrid closed-loop systems (HCLSs) and to the potential 
      of open-source HCLSs, which could be easily adapted to different patients' needs 
      using big data analytics and machine learning. Personalized HCLS algorithms that 
      integrate factors such as patient lifestyle, dietary habits, and hormonal 
      variations are highlighted as critical to reducing the incidence of 
      diabetes-related complications and improving patient outcomes.

AB  - An outcome assessment, the patient assessment used in an endpoint, is the 
      measuring instrument that provides a rating or score (categorical or continuous) 
      that is intended to represent some aspect of the patient's health status. Outcome 
      assessments are used to define efficacy endpoints when developing a therapy for a 
      disease or condition. Most efficacy endpoints are based on specified clinical 
      assessments of patients. When clinical assessments are used as clinical trial 
      outcomes, they are called clinical outcome assessments (COAs). COAs include any 
      assessment that may be influenced by human choices, judgment, or motivation. COAs 
      must be well-defined and possess adequate measurement properties to demonstrate 
      (directly or indirectly) the benefits of a treatment. In contrast, a biomarker 
      assessment is one that is subject to little, if any, patient motivational or 
      rater judgmental influence. This is the first of two reports by the ISPOR 
      Clinical Outcomes Assessment - Emerging Good Practices for Outcomes Research Task 
      Force. This report provides foundational definitions important for an 
      understanding of COA measurement principles. The foundation provided in this 
      report includes what it means to demonstrate a beneficial effect, how assessments 
      of patients relate to the objective of showing a treatment's benefit, and how 
      these assessments are used in clinical trial endpoints. In addition, this report 
      describes intrinsic attributes of patient assessments and clinical trial factors 
      that can affect the properties of the measurements. These factors should be 
      considered when developing or refining assessments. These considerations will aid 
      investigators designing trials in their choice of using an existing assessment or 
      developing a new outcome assessment. Although the focus of this report is on the 
      development of a new COA to define endpoints in a clinical trial, these 
      principles may be applied more generally. A critical element in appraising or 
      developing a COA is to describe the treatment's intended benefit as an effect on 
      a clearly identified aspect of how a patient feels or functions. This aspect must 
      have importance to the patient and be part of the patient's typical life. This 
      meaningful health aspect can be measured directly or measured indirectly when it 
      is impractical to evaluate it directly or when it is difficult to measure. For 
      indirect measurement, a concept of interest (COI) can be identified. The COI must 
      be related to how a patient feels or functions. Procedures are then developed to 
      measure the COI. The relationship of these measurements with how a patient feels 
      or functions in the intended setting and manner of use of the COA (the context of 
      use) could then be defined. A COA has identifiable attributes or characteristics 
      that affect the measurement properties of the COA when used in endpoints. One of 
      these features is whether judgment can influence the measurement, and if so, 
      whose judgment. This attribute defines four categories of COAs: patient reported 
      outcomes, clinician reported outcomes, observer reported outcomes, and 
      performance outcomes. A full description as well as explanation of other 
      important COA features is included in this report. The information in this report 
      should aid in the development, refinement, and standardization of COAs, and, 
      ultimately, improve their measurement properties.

TI  - Understanding Neurogastroenterology From Neuroimaging Perspective: A 
      Comprehensive Review of Functional and Structural Brain Imaging in Functional 
      Gastrointestinal Disorders.
PG  - 512-527
LID - 10.5056/jnm18072 [doi]
AB  - This review provides a comprehensive overview of brain imaging studies of the 
      brain-gut interaction in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). 
      Functional neuroimaging studies during gut stimulation have shown enhanced brain 
      responses in regions related to sensory processing of the homeostatic condition 
      of the gut (homeostatic afferent) and responses to salience stimuli (salience 
      network), as well as increased and decreased brain activity in the emotional 
      response areas and reduced activation in areas associated with the top-down 
      modulation of visceral afferent signals. Altered central regulation of the 
      endocrine and autonomic nervous responses, the key mediators of the brain-gut 
      axis, has been demonstrated. Studies using resting-state functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging reported abnormal local and global connectivity in the areas 
      related to pain processing and the default mode network (a physiological baseline 
      of brain activity at rest associated with self-awareness and memory) in FGIDs. 
      Structural imaging with brain morphometry and diffusion imaging demonstrated 
      altered gray- and white-matter structures in areas that also showed changes in 
      functional imaging studies, although this requires replication. Molecular imaging 
      by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography in FGIDs 
      remains relatively sparse. Progress using analytical methods such as machine 
      learning algorithms may shift neuroimaging studies from brain mapping to 
      predicting clinical outcomes. Because several factors contribute to the 
      pathophysiology of FGIDs and because its population is quite heterogeneous, a new 
      model is needed in future studies to assess the importance of the factors and 
      brain functions that are responsible for an optimal homeostatic state.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of Crown Therapy in Young Individuals with 
      Amelogenesis Imperfecta.
PG  - 1041-7
LID - 10.1177/0022034515584385 [doi]
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel 
      mineralization. Existing treatment recommendations suggest resin-composite 
      restorations until adulthood, although such restorations have a limited 
      longevity. New crown materials allow for minimal preparation techniques. The aim 
      of this study was to compare the quality and longevity of 2 crown types-Procera 
      and IPS e.max Press-in adolescents and young adults with AI. A secondary aim was 
      to document adverse events. We included 27 patients (11 to 22 y of age) with AI 
      in need of crown therapy in a randomized controlled trial using a split-mouth 
      technique. After placing 119 Procera crowns and 108 IPS e.max Press crowns 
      following randomization, we recorded longevity, quality, adverse events, and 
      tooth sensitivity. After 2 y, 97% of the crowns in both crown groups had 
      excellent or acceptable quality. We found no significant differences in quality 
      between Procera and IPS e.max Press crowns. Tooth sensitivity was significantly 
      reduced after crown therapy (P < 0.001). Endodontic complications occurred in 3% 
      of crowns. The results show that it is possible to perform crown therapy with 
      excellent results and without severe complications in young patients with AI. The 
      study is registered at http://www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN70438627).

TI  - A Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry 
      Direct-from-Urine-Specimen Diagnostic for Gram-Negative Pathogens.
PG  - e0373022

AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) pose a major public health burden. The vast 
      majority of UTIs are caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Current culture-based 
      pathogen identification methods may require up to 24 to 48 h of incubation. In 
      this study, we developed and evaluated a method for Gram-negative pathogen 
      identification direct from urine, without culture, via matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in 
      approximately 1 h. Urine samples were collected (n = 137) from the University of 
      Maryland Medical Center clinical microbiology laboratory. To identify bacteria 
      direct from urine, two methods were evaluated. First, 1 μL of urine was directly 
      spotted onto the MALDI target plate, and second, 1 mL of urine was centrifuged at 
      8,000 rpm for 5 min before processing using the fast lipid analysis technique 
      (FLAT). Mass spectra were acquired on the Bruker MALDI Biotyper sirius system in 
      the negative-ion mode. Results were compared to those of standard culture 
      methods. When 1 μL of urine was directly spotted, positive agreement was 81.5% 
      (101/124) and, after centrifugation, 94.4% (117/124) relative to that of standard 
      culture methods. Negative agreement for both methods was 100% (13/13). The time 
      to results for both of the specimen preparation methods using the FLAT extraction 
      protocol was approximately 1 h, with minimal hands-on time required (<5 min). The 
      ability to rapidly identify pathogens directly from urine, without the need for 
      culture, allows for faster turnaround times and, potentially, improved patient 
      outcomes. Overall, the FLAT extraction protocol, in combination with lipid A 
      identification, provides a reproducible and accurate method to rapidly identify 
      urinary pathogens. IMPORTANCE This study describes and evaluates a 
      direct-from-urine extraction method that allows identification of Gram-negative 
      bacteria via MALDI-TOF MS within 1 h. Currently, identification of urinary 
      pathogens requires 24 h of culture prior to identification. While this method may 
      not replace culture, we demonstrate its utility in screening for common urinary 
      pathogens. By providing identifications in under 1 h, clinicians can potentially 
      treat patients sooner with more-targeted antimicrobial therapy. In turn, earlier 
      treatment can improve patient outcome and antimicrobial stewardship. Furthermore, 
      MADLI-TOF MS is a readily available, easy-to-use diagnostic tool in clinical 
      laboratories, making implementation of this method possible.

TI  - Detection of periodontal bone loss patterns and furcation defects from panoramic 
      radiographs using deep learning algorithm: a retrospective study.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.1186/s12903-024-03896-5 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: This retrospective study aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm 
      for the interpretation of panoramic radiographs and to examine the performance of 
      this algorithm in the detection of periodontal bone losses and bone loss 
      patterns. METHODS: A total of 1121 panoramic radiographs were used in this study. 
      Bone losses in the maxilla and mandibula (total alveolar bone loss) (n = 2251), 
      interdental bone losses (n = 25303), and furcation defects (n = 2815) were 
      labeled using the segmentation method. In addition, interdental bone losses were 
      divided into horizontal (n = 21839) and vertical (n = 3464) bone losses according 
      to the defect patterns. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based artificial 
      intelligence (AI) system was developed using U-Net architecture. The performance 
      of the deep learning algorithm was statistically evaluated by the confusion 
      matrix and ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: The system showed the highest diagnostic 
      performance in the detection of total alveolar bone losses (AUC = 0.951) and the 
      lowest in the detection of vertical bone losses (AUC = 0.733). The sensitivity, 
      precision, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC values were found as 1, 0.995, 0.997, 
      0.994, 0.951 for total alveolar bone loss; found as 0.947, 0.939, 0.943, 0.892, 
      0.910 for horizontal bone losses; found as 0.558, 0.846, 0.673, 0.506, 0.733 for 
      vertical bone losses and found as 0.892, 0.933, 0.912, 0.837, 0.868 for furcation 
      defects (respectively). CONCLUSIONS: AI systems offer promising results in 
      determining periodontal bone loss patterns and furcation defects from dental 
      radiographs. This suggests that CNN algorithms can also be used to provide more 
      detailed information such as automatic determination of periodontal disease 
      severity and treatment planning in various dental radiographs.

TI  - Comparative study of ChatGPT and human evaluators on the assessment of medical 
      literature according to recognised reporting standards.
LID - 10.1136/bmjhci-2023-100830 [doi]
LID - e100830
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Amid clinicians' challenges in staying updated with medical 
      research, artificial intelligence (AI) tools like the large language model (LLM) 
      ChatGPT could automate appraisal of research quality, saving time and reducing 
      bias. This study compares the proficiency of ChatGPT3 against human evaluation in 
      scoring abstracts to determine its potential as a tool for evidence synthesis. 
      METHODS: We compared ChatGPT's scoring of implant dentistry abstracts with human 
      evaluators using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for Abstracts 
      reporting standards checklist, yielding an overall compliance score (OCS). 
      Bland-Altman analysis assessed agreement between human and AI-generated OCS 
      percentages. Additional error analysis included mean difference of OCS subscores, 
      Welch's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Bland-Altman 
      analysis showed a mean difference of 4.92% (95% CI 0.62%, 0.37%) in OCS between 
      human evaluation and ChatGPT. Error analysis displayed small mean differences in 
      most domains, with the highest in 'conclusion' (0.764 (95% CI 0.186, 0.280)) and 
      the lowest in 'blinding' (0.034 (95% CI 0.818, 0.895)). The strongest 
      correlations between were in 'harms' (r=0.32, p<0.001) and 'trial registration' 
      (r=0.34, p=0.002), whereas the weakest were in 'intervention' (r=0.02, p<0.001) 
      and 'objective' (r=0.06, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: LLMs like ChatGPT can help 
      automate appraisal of medical literature, aiding in the identification of 
      accurately reported research. Possible applications of ChatGPT include 
      integration within medical databases for abstract evaluation. Current limitations 
      include the token limit, restricting its usage to abstracts. As AI technology 
      advances, future versions like GPT4 could offer more reliable, comprehensive 
      evaluations, enhancing the identification of high-quality research and 
      potentially improving patient outcomes.

TI  - STS-TransUNet: Semi-supervised Tooth Segmentation Transformer U-Net for dental 
      panoramic image.
PG  - 2366-2384
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2024104 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning method for dental panoramic 
      image segmentation, which is crucial in oral medicine and orthodontics for 
      accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods often fail to 
      effectively combine global and local context, and struggle with unlabeled data, 
      limiting performance in varied clinical settings. We address these issues with an 
      advanced TransUNet architecture, enhancing feature retention and utilization by 
      connecting the input and output layers directly. Our architecture further employs 
      spatial and channel attention mechanisms in the decoder segments for targeted 
      region focus, and deep supervision techniques to overcome the vanishing gradient 
      problem for more efficient training. Additionally, our network includes a 
      self-learning algorithm using unlabeled data, boosting generalization 
      capabilities. Named the Semi-supervised Tooth Segmentation Transformer U-Net 
      (STS-TransUNet), our method demonstrated superior performance on the MICCAI 
      STS-2D dataset, proving its effectiveness and robustness in tooth segmentation 
      tasks.

TI  - DilatedToothSegNet: Tooth Segmentation Network on 3D Dental Meshes Through 
      Increasing Receptive Vision.
LID - 10.1007/s10278-024-01061-6 [doi]
AB  - The utilization of advanced intraoral scanners to acquire 3D dental models has 
      gained significant popularity in the fields of dentistry and orthodontics. 
      Accurate segmentation and labeling of teeth on digitized 3D dental surface models 
      are crucial for computer-aided treatment planning. At the same time, manual 
      labeling of these models is a time-consuming task. Recent advances in geometric 
      deep learning have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in surface segmentation 
      when applied to raw 3D models. However, segmentation of the dental surface 
      remains challenging due to the atypical and diverse appearance of the patients' 
      teeth. Numerous deep learning methods have been proposed to automate dental 
      surface segmentation. Nevertheless, they still show limitations, particularly in 
      cases where teeth are missing or severely misaligned. To overcome these 
      challenges, we introduce a network operator called dilated edge convolution, 
      which enhances the network's ability to learn additional, more distant features 
      by expanding its receptive field. This leads to improved segmentation results, 
      particularly in complex and challenging cases. To validate the effectiveness of 
      our proposed method, we performed extensive evaluations on the recently published 
      benchmark data set for dental model segmentation Teeth3DS. We compared our 
      approach with several other state-of-the-art methods using a quantitative and 
      qualitative analysis. Through these evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority 
      of our proposed method, showcasing its ability to outperform existing approaches 
      in dental surface segmentation.

TI  - Comparison of three rapid diagnostic tests for bloodstream infections using 
      Benefit-risk Evaluation Framework (BED-FRAME).

AB  - Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for bloodstream infections have the potential to 
      reduce time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy and improve patient outcomes. 
      Previously, an in-house, lipid-based, matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method, 
      Fast Lipid Analysis Technique (FLAT MS), has shown promise as a rapid pathogen 
      identification method. In this study, FLAT MS for direct from blood culture 
      identification was evaluated and compared to FDA-cleared identification methods 
      using the Benefit-risk Evaluation Framework (BED-FRAME) analysis. FLAT MS was 
      evaluated and compared to Bruker Sepsityper and bioMérieux BioFire FilmArray 
      BCID2 using results from a previous study. For this study, 301 positive blood 
      cultures were collected from the University of Maryland Medical Center. The RDTs 
      were compared by their sensitivities, time-to-results, hands-on time, and 
      BED-FRAME analysis. The overall sensitivity of all platforms compared to culture 
      results from monomicrobial-positive blood cultures was 88.3%. However, the three 
      RDTs differed in their accuracy for identifying Gram-positive bacteria, 
      Gram-negative bacteria, and yeast. Time-to-results for FLAT MS, Sepsityper, and 
      BioFire BCID2 were all approximately one hour. Hands-on times for FLAT MS, 
      Sepsityper, and BioFire BCID2 were 10 (±1.3), 40 (±2.8), and 5 (±0.25) minutes, 
      respectively. BED-FRAME demonstrated that each RDT had utility at different 
      pathogen prevalence and relative importance. BED-FRAME is a useful tool that can 
      used to determine which RDT is best for a healthcare center.

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a prevalent and aggressive neoplasm, poses a 
      significant challenge due to poor prognosis and limited prognostic biomarkers. 
      Leveraging highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry, we investigated the tumor 
      immune microenvironment (TIME) in OSCC biopsies, characterizing immune cell 
      distribution and signaling activity at the tumor-invasive front. Our spatial 
      subsetting approach standardized cellular populations by tissue zone, improving 
      feature reproducibility and revealing TIME patterns accompanying 
      loss-of-differentiation. Employing a machine-learning pipeline combining reliable 
      feature selection with multivariable modeling, we achieved accurate histological 
      grade classification (AUC = 0.88). Three model features correlated with clinical 
      outcomes in an independent cohort: granulocyte MAPKAPK2 signaling at the tumor 
      front, stromal CD4(+) memory T cell size, and the distance of fibroblasts from 
      the tumor border. This study establishes a robust modeling framework for 
      distilling complex imaging data, uncovering sentinel characteristics of the OSCC 
      TIME to facilitate prognostic biomarkers discovery for recurrence risk 
      stratification and immunomodulatory therapy development.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect 
      in enamel mineralization. Several problems are associated with AI: 
      hypersensitivity, wear, restorations requiring replacement, gingivitis, aesthetic 
      problems, and social avoidance. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 
      crown therapy in young individuals with AI showing excellent results. This study 
      reports results from a long-term-follow-up with focus on quality, longevity and 
      adverse events. METHODS: The RCT included 27 patients (aged 11-22 years) with 
      severe AI in need of crown therapy and used a split-mouth technique. After 
      placing 119 Procera(®) crowns and 108 IPS e.max Press crowns following 
      randomization, we assessed longevity, quality, adverse events, and tooth 
      sensitivity and calculated survival rates and success rates. RESULTS: We followed 
      the original 227 crowns for 4.3-7.4 years (mean 5.5 ± 0.8). In all, 79% (193) 
      crowns were followed for at least 5 years. The survival rate was 99.6% and the 
      success rate, 94.7%; 95% of the crowns had excellent or acceptable quality. Due 
      to suboptimal marginal integrity, 4% of the crowns required adjustment. 
      Sensitivity problems decreased after crown therapy (p < 0.001). All adverse 
      events occurred in patients aged 19-23 years and involved apical periodontitis 
      (3% of teeth); all but two events were related to dental trauma in the actual 
      tooth. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramic crown therapy in adolescents and young adults with 
      severe forms of AI show excellent survival and success rates and longevity with 
      few adverse events. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Ceramic crown therapy can be 
      recommended for adolescents and young adults with severe forms of amelogenesis 
      imperfecta.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate segmentation of individual tooth and their substructures 
      including enamel, pulp, and dentin from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
      images is essential for dental diagnosis and treatment planning in digital 
      dentistry. Existing methods for tooth segmentation based on CBCT images have 
      achieved substantial progress; however, techniques for further segmentation into 
      substructures are yet to be developed. PURPOSE: We aim to propose a novel 
      three-stage progressive deep-learning-based framework for automatically 
      segmenting 3D tooth from CBCT images, focusing on finer substructures, i.e., 
      enamel, pulp, and dentin. METHODS: In this paper, we first detect each tooth 
      using its centroid by a clustering scheme, which efficiently determines each 
      tooth detection by applying learned displacement vectors from the foreground 
      tooth region. Next, guided by the detected centroid, each tooth proposal, 
      combined with the corresponding tooth map, is processed through our tooth 
      segmentation network. We also present an attention-based hybrid feature fusion 
      mechanism, which provides intricate details of the tooth boundary while 
      maintaining the global tooth shape, thereby enhancing the segmentation process. 
      Additionally, we utilize the skeleton of the tooth as a guide for subsequent 
      substructure segmentation. RESULTS: Our algorithm is extensively evaluated on a 
      collected dataset of 314 patients, and the extensive comparison and ablation 
      studies demonstrate superior segmentation results of our approach. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our proposed method can automatically segment tooth and finer substructures from 
      CBCT images, underlining its potential applicability for clinical diagnosis and 
      surgical treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: First we aimed to identify significant associations between 
      preoperative risk factors and achieving optimal root filling length (RFL) during 
      orthograde root canal treatments (RCT) and second to predict successful RFL using 
      machine learning. METHODS: Teeth receiving RCT at one university clinic from 
      2016-2020 with complete documentation were included. Successful RFL was defined 
      to be 0-2mm of the apex, suboptimal RFL >2mm or beyond the apex. Logistic 
      regression (logR) was used for association analyses; logR and more advanced 
      machine learning (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree 
      (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)) were 
      employed for predictive modeling. RESULTS: 555 completed RCT (343 patients, 
      female/male 32.1/67.9%) were included. In our association analysis (involving the 
      full dataset), unsuccessful RFL was more likely in undergraduate students (US): 
      OR 2.74, 95% CI [1.61, 4.75], p < 0.001), teeth with indistinct canal paths (OR 
      11.04, [2.87, 44.88], p < 0.001), root canals reduced in size (OR 2.56, [1.49, 
      4.46], p < 0.01), retreatments (OR 3.13, [1.6, 6.41], p < 0.001). Subgroup 
      analyses revealed that dentists were more successful in mitigating risks than 
      undergraduate students. Prediction of RFL on a separate testset was limitedly 
      possible regardless of the machine learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving RFL 
      is depending on the operator and several risk factors. The predictive performance 
      on the technical outcome of a root canal treatment utilizing ML algorithms was 
      insufficient. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Preoperative risk assessment is a relevant 
      step in endodontic treatment planning. Single radiographic risk factors were 
      significantly associated with achieving (or not achieving) optimal RFL and showed 
      higher predictive value than a more complex risk assessment form.

TI  - An automatic cephalometric landmark detection method based on heatmap regression 
      and Monte Carlo dropout.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341102 [doi]
AB  - Cephalometric analysis plays an important role in orthodontic diagnosis and 
      treatment planning. It depends on the detection of multiple landmarks, while the 
      process is time-consuming and tedious. Although some deep learning-based 
      automatic landmark detection algorithms have achieved excellent performance, most 
      of them adopt multi-stage models increasing the complexity and detection time. 
      Meanwhile, few studies focused on the uncertainty of detection results, thereby 
      ignoring its significant clinical value. In this paper, we propose a novel 
      approach based on heatmap regression for landmark detection, which can achieve 
      competitive accuracy and good robustness with only one step. Furthermore, by 
      applying Monte Carlo dropout to a U-shaped convolutional neural network, we can 
      obtain not only the coordinate of each landmark but also the corresponding simple 
      uncertainty, so that doctors can pay more attention to those landmarks with 
      higher uncertainty. The evaluation results showed the mean radial error is 
      1.39±1.06mm and the average successful detection rate is 79.65%, 97.22% within 
      2mm, 4mm for the IEEE ISBI2015 Test Dataset 1, the indicators for the IEEE 
      ISBI2015 Test Dataset 2 are 1.33±0.93mm, 80.05% and 97.53%, respectively. Our 
      method has the potential to become an assistant tool in clinical practice. 
      Automatic and accurate detection with uncertainty analysis is expected to help 
      guide the doctor's judgment.

TI  - A piezo surgery with corticotomies and implant placement as part of a 
      multidisciplinary approach to treat malocclusion disorder in an adult patient: 
      clinical report.
PG  - 23
LID - 23
AB  - This clinical report illustrates a multidisciplinary approach for the 
      rehabilitation of a young adult patient affected by a bilateral edentulous space 
      and an anterior deep bite. The patient required orthodontics and surgical 
      corticotomy and implantology (both performed with a piezo device). A 
      multidisciplinary planning approach, including orthodontics, oral and periodontic 
      surgery, and restorative dentistry, has an important role in the final outcome of 
      treatment. In fact a dental class I occlusion has been established only on the 
      right side. The left side could not be restored to an ideal class I relationship 
      due to the pontic prosthesis. The original collapsed right posterior occlusion 
      was corrected. A stable posterior occlusion was established, and the balancing 
      interference was eliminated. Centric relation and centric occlusion were 
      established at the same vertical dimension of occlusion. The cephalometric 
      analysis and clinical aspect at the end of treatment showed that the patient had 
      improvements in overbite and overjet.Multidisciplinary management, including 
      endodontic and restorative dentistry, periodontics, corticotomy-assisted 
      orthodontics, implants, and prosthetics, was used for a young female patient with 
      multiple missing teeth, anterior deep bite, and a malocclusion with cant of the 
      occlusal plane. The interaction of interdisciplinary specialties and careful 
      treatment planning were required. The patient also benefited esthetically from 
      our effort.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prediction of lip prominence based on hard-tissue measurements 
      could be helpful in orthodontic treatment planning and has been challenging and 
      formidable thus far. METHODS: A machine learning-based cross-sectional study was 
      conducted on 1549 patients. Hard-tissue measurements and demographic information 
      were used as the input features. Seven popular machine learning algorithms were 
      applied to the datasets to predict upper and lower lip prominence. The algorithm 
      that performed the best was selected for the construction of the prediction 
      model. Evaluation of feature importance was conducted using 3 classical methods. 
      RESULTS: Among the 7 algorithms, the XGBoost model performed the best in the 
      prediction of the distances between labrale superius or labrale inferius to the 
      esthetics plane (UL-EP and LL-EP distances), with root mean square error values 
      of 1.25, 1.49 and r(2) values of 0.755 and 0.683, respectively. Among the 14 
      input features, the L1-NB distance contributed the most to the prominences of the 
      upper and lower lips. A lip prominence predictor was developed to facilitate 
      clinical application by deploying the prediction model into a downloadable tool 
      kit. CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model performed well with high accuracy and 
      practicability in predicting upper and lower lip prominence. The artificial 
      intelligence-aided predictor could serve as a reference for orthodontic treatment 
      planning.

TI  - Are multi-detector computed tomography and cone-beam computed tomography exams 
      and software accurate to measure the upper airway? A systematic review.
PG  - 818-831
LID - 10.1093/ejo/cjad060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has several applications in 
      various fields of dental medicine such as diagnosis and treatment planning. When 
      compared to computed tomography (CT), CBCT's radiation exposure dose is decreased 
      by 3%-20%. However, CBCT produces more scattered signals and may present poorer 
      image quality when compared to medical CT. OBJECTIVES: To review the findings 
      regarding the accuracy of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and CBCT and 
      to compare the different software programs that segment the upper airway. SEARCH 
      METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science) were searched for 
      articles and a manual search was performed. SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion 
      criteria were defined following the PICO framework: P-any patient with a CBCT or 
      CT; I-dimensional evaluation of the upper airway using MDCT or CBCT; C-phantoms; 
      O-the primary outcome was MDCT and CBCT accuracy, the secondary outcome was the 
      evaluation and comparison of software programs used to segment the upper airway. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Articles that met eligibility criteria were 
      assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Checklist. RESULTS: Among 
      the 16 eligible studies, 6 articles referred to the accuracy of MDCTs or CBCTs 
      and 10 to the accuracy of the software. Most articles were qualified as high 
      quality. CONCLUSIONS: MDCT and CBCT scans' accuracy in upper airway dimensional 
      measurements depends on machine brand, parameters, and segmentation technique. 
      Regarding the segmentation technique, 12 programs were studied. Most either 
      underestimated or overestimated upper airway measurements. In particular, 
      OnDemand3D and INVIVO showed poor accuracy. On the contrary, Invesalius, and 
      MIMICS were accurate in assessing nasal cavities when using an interactive 
      threshold. However, results varied due to methodological differences among the 
      studies. Finally, fully automatic segmentation based on artificial intelligence 
      may represent the future of airway segmentation because it is faster and seems to 
      be accurate. However, further studies are necessary. REGISTRATION: This study was 
      registered in Prospero (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) 
      with the ID number CRD42022373998.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases observed in 
      elderly patients. The development of preventive strategies for dental caries in 
      elderly individuals is vital. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was 
      to construct a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) prediction model for 
      the risk assessment of dental caries among the geriatric residents of Liaoning, 
      China. METHODS: A stratified equal-capacity random sampling method was used to 
      randomly select 1144 elderly (65-74 years) residents (gender ratio 1 : 1) of 
      Liaoning, China. Data for the oral assessment, including caries characteristics, 
      and questionnaire survey from each participant were collected. Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify the independent 
      predictors. GRNN was applied to establish a prediction model for dental caries. 
      The accuracy of the unconditional logistic regression and the GRNN early warning 
      model was compared. RESULTS: A total of 1144 patients fulfilled the requirements 
      and completed the questionnaires. The caries rate was 68.5%, and the main 
      associated factors were toothache history, residence area, smoking, and drinking. 
      We randomly divided the data for the 1144 participants into a training set (915 
      cases) and a test set (229 cases). The optimal smoothing factor was 0.7, and the 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the GRNN model was 
      0.626 (95% confidence interval, 0.544 to 0.708), with a P value of 0.002. In 
      terms of consistency, sensitivity, and specificity, the GRNN model was better 
      than the traditional unconditional multivariate logistic regression model. 
      CONCLUSION: Geriatric (65-74 years) residents of Liaoning, China, have a high 
      rate of dental caries. Residents with a history of toothache and smoking habits 
      are more susceptible to the disease. The GRNN early warning model is an accurate 
      and meaningful tool for screening, early diagnosis, and treatment planning for 
      geriatric individuals with a high risk of caries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 
      significant morbidity and mortality; large numbers of patients require intensive 
      care, which is placing strain on health care systems worldwide. There is an 
      urgent need for a COVID-19 disease severity assessment that can assist in patient 
      triage and resource allocation for patients at risk for severe disease. 
      OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and scale a clinical 
      decision support system and mobile app to assist in COVID-19 severity assessment, 
      management, and care. METHODS: Model training data from 701 patients with 
      COVID-19 were collected across practices within the Family Health Centers network 
      at New York University Langone Health. A two-tiered model was developed. Tier 1 
      uses easily available, nonlaboratory data to help determine whether 
      biomarker-based testing and/or hospitalization is necessary. Tier 2 predicts the 
      probability of mortality using biomarker measurements (C-reactive protein, 
      procalcitonin, D-dimer) and age. Both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 models were validated 
      using two external datasets from hospitals in Wuhan, China, comprising 160 and 
      375 patients, respectively. RESULTS: All biomarkers were measured at 
      significantly higher levels in patients who died vs those who were not 
      hospitalized or discharged (P<.001). The Tier 1 and Tier 2 internal validations 
      had areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.95 (95% CI 
      0.92-0.98), respectively. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 external validations had AUCs of 
      0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results demonstrate the validity of the clinical decision support system and 
      mobile app, which are now ready to assist health care providers in making 
      evidence-based decisions when managing COVID-19 patient care. The deployment of 
      these new capabilities has potential for immediate impact in community clinics 
      and sites, where application of these tools could lead to improvements in patient 
      outcomes and cost containment.

TI  - Quantitative ultrasound radiomics in predicting response to neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer: Results from 
      multi-institutional study.
PG  - 5798-5806
LID - 10.1002/cam4.3255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted in order to develop a model for predicting 
      response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced 
      breast cancer (LABC) using pretreatment quantitative ultrasound (QUS) radiomics. 
      METHODS: This was a multicenter study involving four sites across North America, 
      and appropriate approval was obtained from the individual ethics committees. 
      Eighty-two patients with LABC were included for final analysis. Primary tumors 
      were scanned using a clinical ultrasound system before NAC was started. The 
      tumors were contoured, and radiofrequency data were acquired and processed from 
      whole tumor regions of interest. QUS spectral parameters were derived from the 
      normalized power spectrum, and texture analysis was performed based on six QUS 
      features using a gray level co-occurrence matrix. Patients were divided into 
      responder or nonresponder classes based on their clinical-pathological response. 
      Classification analysis was performed using machine learning algorithms, which 
      were trained to optimize classification accuracy. Cross-validation was performed 
      using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. RESULTS: Based on the clinical 
      outcomes of NAC treatment, there were 48 responders and 34 nonresponders. A 
      K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) approach resulted in the best classifier performance, 
      with a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 83%, and an accuracy of 87%. 
      CONCLUSION: QUS-based radiomics can predict response to NAC based on pretreatment 
      features with acceptable accuracy.

TI  - The Association Between Developmental Defects of Enamel and Early Childhood 
      Caries in American Indian Children: A Retrospective Chart Review.
PG  - 126-131
AB  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence of developmental defects of enamel (DDE) 
      among American Indian (AI) children and whether DDE are associated with caries 
      experience and rehabilitative treatment under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: 
      This retrospective study reviewed charts of 557 AI children, between 12 and 84 
      months of age, served by one Indian Health Service clinic in Sisseton, SD, USA. 
      Analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics, including odds ratios 
      (OR). P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The overall prevalence of DDE 
      was 32.5% (mean equals 0.87±1.59 per child). The presence of DDE was associated 
      with significantly higher mean decayed, extracted and filled (deft) scores 
      (7.94±5.06 versus 4.84±5.14; P<0.001), predicting adverse clinical outcomes. 
      Children with DDE had 3.8, 4.2, and 3.4 times the odds of having caries, 
      early-childhood-caries (ECC), and severe early-childhood-caries (S-ECC), 
      respectively, than those without DDE. DDE were also associated with higher odds 
      of treatment under GA (OR equals 4.4). Conclusions: DDE were prevalent in this 
      cohort of AI children and found to be significantly associated with a higher 
      caries burden and dental rehabilitation under GA. Early recognition of DDE in 
      infants and toddlers along with targeted prevention programs may help reduce the 
      incidence of caries and subsequent treatment under GA.

TI  - Automatic tooth periodontal ligament segmentation of cone beam computed 
      tomography based on instance segmentation network.
PG  - e24097
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24097 [doi]
LID - e24097
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The three-dimensional morphological structures of periodontal 
      ligaments (PDLs) are important data for periodontal, orthodontic, prosthodontic, 
      and implant interventions. This study aimed to employ a deep learning (DL) 
      algorithm to segment the PDL automatically in cone-beam computed tomography 
      (CBCT). METHOD: This was a retrospective study. We randomly selected 389 patients 
      and 1734 axial CBCT images from the CBCT database, and designed a fully automatic 
      PDL segmentation computer-aided model based on instance segmentation Mask R-CNN 
      network. The labels of the model training were 'teeth' and 'alveolar bone', and 
      the 'PDL' is defined as the region where the 'teeth' and 'alveolar bone' overlap. 
      The model's segmentation performance was evaluated using CBCT data from eight 
      patients outside the database. RESULTS: Qualitative evaluation indicates that the 
      PDL segmentation accuracy of incisors, canines, premolars, wisdom teeth, and 
      implants reached 100%. The segmentation accuracy of molars was 96.4%. 
      Quantitative evaluation indicates that the mIoU and mDSC of PDL segmentation were 
      0.667 ± 0.015 (>0.6) and 0.799 ± 0.015 (>0.7) respectively. CONCLUSION: This 
      study analysed a unique approach to AI-driven automatic segmentation of PDLs on 
      CBCT imaging, possibly enabling chair-side measurements of PDLs to facilitate 
      periodontists, orthodontists, prosthodontists, and implantologists in more 
      efficient and accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Predictive analysis can be used to evaluate the enormous data 
      generated by the healthcare industry to extract information and establish 
      relationships amongst the variables. It uses artificial intelligence to reveal 
      associations not suspected by the healthcare professionals. Tobacco cessation is 
      clearly beneficial; however, many tobacco users respond differently as it is 
      based on multitude of factors. Our objectives were to assess the data mining 
      techniques using the WEKA tool, evaluate its role in predictive analysis, and to 
      predict the quit status of patients using prediction algorithms in tobacco 
      cessation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WEKA, a data mining tool, was used to classify 
      the data and evaluate them using 10-fold cross-validations. The various 
      algorithms used in this tool are Naïve Bayes, SMO, Random Forest, J-48, and 
      Decision Stump to further analyze its role in determining the quit status of 
      patients. For this, secondary data of 655 patients from a tobacco cessation 
      clinic were utilized and described using 20 different attributes for prediction 
      of quit status. RESULTS: The Decision Stump and SMO were found to be having the 
      best prediction and accuracy for prediction of the quit status. Out of 20 
      attributes, previous quitting attempt, type of intervention, and number of years 
      since the habit was initiated were found to be associated with early quitting 
      rate. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that data mining and predictive analytical 
      models like WEKA tool will not only improve patient outcomes but identify 
      variables or a combination of variables for effective interventions in tobacco 
      cessation.

TI  - Does crown, root, and bone visualization in a clear aligner virtual setup impact 
      treatment decisions?
LID - S0889-5406(24)00061-1 [pii]

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clear aligner technology based on a machine learning algorithm is 
      currently available for orthodontic treatment. Treatment planning on the basis of 
      3-dimensional crown, root, and bone imaging is claimed to provide accurate 
      diagnosis and better treatment outcomes for adult patients with complex needs. 
      This study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) would practitioners 
      modify their original treatment plan once provided with the crown, root, and bone 
      view? and (2) does practitioner satisfaction regarding treatment outcomes change 
      once the crown, root, and bone view is provided? METHODS: An online questionnaire 
      was emailed to members of the American Association of Orthodontists (n = 2300) 
      and the Virginia Orthodontic Education and Research Foundation (n = 211). The 
      survey consisted of videos of 4 patients shown in 2 presentations: crown-only and 
      crown, root, and bone views, generated by artificial intelligence-driven 
      treatment planning software (3D Predict aligner system; 3D Predict, New York, 
      NY). Respondents were asked to answer treatment-related questions and rate the 
      treatment outcomes using a visual analog scale. Statistical analyses were 
      completed to determine the significance of crown, root, and bone view on 
      treatment planning with clear aligners. RESULTS: A total of 70 orthodontists 
      participated in the survey. There were significant differences in responses when 
      viewing patients in crown-only and crown, root, and bone presentations. Across 
      the 4 patients, 33%-43% of practitioners changed their sentiment toward the 
      treatment plan (P <0.001). When rating satisfaction on the 100-point scale, 
      average ratings changed by 10.6 to 21.0 points; both increases and decreases in 
      satisfaction were seen across the patients (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When given 
      3-dimensional information on the position of a patient's crowns, root, and bone 
      coverage, orthodontists are likely to change their clear aligner treatment plan. 
      This study showed that a confirmation of dehiscence and fenestrations using the 
      root and bone view resulted in practitioner dissatisfaction despite an initial 
      satisfaction with the crown-only view.

TI  - Analyzes In Silico Indicate the lncRNAs MIR31HG and LINC00939 as Possible 
      Epigenetic Inhibitors of the Osteogenic Differentiation in PDLCs.

AB  - Chromatin conformation, DNA methylation pattern, transcriptional profile, and 
      non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) interactions constitute an epigenetic pattern that 
      influences the cellular phenotypic commitment and impacts the clinical outcomes 
      in regenerative therapies. Here, we investigated the epigenetic landscape of the 
      SP7 transcriptor factor (SP7) and Distal-Less Homeobox 4 (DLX4) osteoblastic 
      transcription factors (TFs), in human periodontal ligament mesenchymal cells 
      (PDLCs) with low (l-PDLCs) and high (h-PDLCs) osteogenic potential. Chromatin 
      accessibility (ATAC-seq), genome DNA methylation (Methylome), and RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) assays were performed in l- and h-PDLCs, cultured at 10 days in 
      non-induced (DMEM) and osteogenic (OM) medium in vitro. Data were processed in 
      HOMER, Genome Studio, and edgeR programs, and metadata was analyzed by online 
      bioinformatics tools and in R and Python environments. ATAC-seq analyses showed 
      the TFs genomic regions are more accessible in l-PDLCs than in h-PDLCs. In 
      Methylome analyses, the TFs presented similar average methylation intensities 
      (AMIs), without differently methylated probes (DMPs) between l- and h-PDLCs; in 
      addition, there were no differences in the expression profiles of TFs signaling 
      pathways. Interestingly, we identified the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 
      MIR31HG and LINC00939, as upregulated in l-PDLCs, in both DMEM and OM. In the 
      following analysis, the web-based prediction tool LncRRIsearch predicted RNA:RNA 
      base-pairing interactions between SP7, DLX4, MIR31HG, and LINC00939 transcripts. 
      The machine learning program TriplexFPP predicted DNA:RNA triplex-forming 
      potential for the SP7 DNA site and for one of the LINC00939 transcripts 
      (ENST00000502479). PCR data confirmed the upregulation of MIR31HG and LINC00939 
      transcripts in l-PDLCs (× h-PDLCs) in both DMEM and OM (p < 0.05); conversely, 
      SP7 and DLX4 were downregulated, confirming those results observed in the RNA-Seq 
      analysis. Together, these results indicate the lncRNAs MIR31HG and LINC00939 as 
      possible epigenetic inhibitors of the osteogenic differentiation in PDLCs by 
      (post)transcriptional and translational repression of the SP7 and DLX4 TFs.

TI  - Secular trends in ischemic stroke subtypes and stroke risk factors.
PG  - 3208-13
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006536 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early diagnosis and treatment of a stroke improves 
      patient outcomes, and knowledge of the cause of the initial event is crucial to 
      identification of the appropriate therapy to maximally reduce risk of recurrence. 
      Assumptions based on historical frequency of ischemic subtypes may need revision 
      if stroke subtypes are changing as a result of recent changes in therapy, such as 
      increased use of statins. METHODS: We analyzed secular trends in stroke risk 
      factors and ischemic stroke subtypes among patients with transient ischemic 
      attack or minor or moderate stroke referred to an urgent transient ischemic 
      attack clinic from 2002 to 2012. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, associated with a 
      significant decline in large artery stroke and small vessel stroke. The 
      proportion of cardioembolic stroke increased from 26% in 2002 to 56% in 2012 
      (P<0.05 for trend). Trends remained significant after adjusting for population 
      change. CONCLUSIONS: With more intensive medical management in the community, a 
      significant decrease in atherosclerotic risk factors was observed, with a 
      significant decline in stroke/transient ischemic attack caused by large artery 
      atherosclerosis and small vessel disease. As a result, cardioembolic 
      stroke/transient ischemic attack has increased significantly. Our findings 
      suggest that more intensive investigation for cardiac sources of embolism and 
      greater use of anticoagulation may be warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted 
      pathogen with significant reproductive health implications. Data are mounting 
      that the bacterial communities that reside within the vagina, collectively termed 
      the vaginal microbiota, aid in defense against sexually transmitted infections. 
      Disruptions in the vaginal microbiota, such as during episodes of bacterial 
      vaginosis, may increase susceptibility to infection. Herein, we describe the 
      clinical core protocol for a NIH NIAID Cooperative Research Center titled 
      Eco-Pathogenomic of Chlamydial Reproductive Tract Infection. The primary goals of 
      the project are to describe the interrelationships between the urogenital 
      microenvironment, the properties of the pathogen and immunologic responses of the 
      host in men and women, and their association with clinical outcomes of CT 
      infection in women. METHODS: Men and women with confirmed genital CT infections 
      were recruited to a number of study protocols, including cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal sub-studies. Participants completed a demographic and sexual health 
      questionnaire and underwent a physical exam at baseline. In the longitudinal 
      study arms, biologic samples were collected daily, weekly, and monthly to 
      determine the relationships between the vaginal microbiota, prevalent CT 
      infection, re-infection and treatment. DISCUSSION: The biological samples and the 
      demographic and history information collected throughout this study will be used

AB  - A clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) assessment is a type of clinical outcome 
      assessment (COA). ClinRO assessments, like all COAs (patient-reported, 
      observer-reported, or performance outcome assessments), are used to 1) measure 
      patients' health status and 2) define end points that can be interpreted as 
      treatment benefits of medical interventions on how patients feel, function, or 
      survive in clinical trials. Like other COAs, ClinRO assessments can be influenced 
      by human choices, judgment, or motivation. A ClinRO assessment is conducted and 
      reported by a trained health care professional and requires specialized 
      professional training to evaluate the patient's health status. This is the second 
      of two reports by the ISPOR Clinical Outcomes Assessment-Emerging Good Practices 
      for Outcomes Research Task Force. The first report provided an overview of COAs 
      including definitions important for an understanding of COA measurement 
      practices. This report focuses specifically on issues related to ClinRO 
      assessments. In this report, we define three types of ClinRO assessments 
      (readings, ratings, and clinician global assessments) and describe emerging good 
      measurement practices in their development and evaluation. The good measurement 
      practices include 1) defining the context of use; 2) identifying the concept of 
      interest measured; 3) defining the intended treatment benefit on how patients 
      feel, function, or survive reflected by the ClinRO assessment and evaluating the 
      relationship between that intended treatment benefit and the concept of interest; 
      4) documenting content validity; 5) evaluating other measurement properties once 
      content validity is established (including intra- and inter-rater reliability); 
      6) defining study objectives and end point(s) objectives, and defining study end 
      points and placing study end points within the hierarchy of end points; 7) 
      establishing interpretability in trial results; and 8) evaluating operational 
      considerations for the implementation of ClinRO assessments used as end points in 
      clinical trials. Applying good measurement practices to ClinRO assessment 
      development and evaluation will lead to more efficient and accurate measurement 
      of treatment effects. This is important beyond regulatory approval in that it 
      provides evidence for the uptake of new interventions into clinical practice and 
      provides justification to payers for reimbursement on the basis of the clearly 
      demonstrated added value of the new intervention.

TI  - A provider-observed tool to assess Oral Hygiene Skill Mastery (OHSIM) in human

PG  - 147-157
LID - 10.1111/scd.12355 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Periodontal diseases (PDs) affect nearly half of Americans ≥30 years old 
      and are common in human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) adults. A 
      validated measure of oral hygiene skill could improve tailored prevention-focused 
      health communication. METHODS: We developed Oral Hygiene Skill Mastery (OHSIM), a 
      provider-observed measure of toothbrushing and flossing ability. We examined 
      OHSIM's inter-rater reliability (IRR) and concurrent validity using a blinded, 
      cross-sectional study design with a convenience sample of HIV+/- adults. Clinical 
      outcome measures included bleeding on probing (BOP) and abbreviated plaque and 
      gingival indices. Analyses included IRR and, after identifying relevant predictor 
      variables for each outcome, backward elimination regression and structural 
      equation modeling (SEM) were used to demonstrate concurrent validity. RESULTS: We 
      saw 173 research participants (reliability: n = 61; validity: n = 112). The 
      average IRR was α = 0.73 for toothbrushing and α = 0.84 for flossing. 
      Toothbrushing and flossing skill were moderately correlated (r = 0.49, 
      P < 0.001). SEM analyses demonstrated that OHSIM toothbrushing significantly and 
      independently predicted variance in plaque and gingival indices and BOP, while 
      OHSIM flossing skill significantly and independently predicted plaque index and 
      BOP. CONCLUSION: OHSIM is a provisionally reliable and valid provider-observed 
      measure of toothbrushing and flossing skill. Most predictors of clinical outcomes 
      were modifiable behaviors. Toothbrushing quality is a critical component of oral 
      health.

      limb ischaemia].
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.33529/ANGIO2019305 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The study was aimed at assessing efficacy and safety of treatment with 
      Aducil® (cilostazol) compared with Trental® 400 in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe intermittent claudication due to peripheral atherosclerosis. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included a total of one hundred and forty-five 
      36-to-75-year-old patients. The participants were distributed into 2 groups 
      according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria in a 2 to 1 proportion: patients in 
      group 1 received Aducil® 100 mg BID, in group 2 - Trental® 400 TID for 12 weeks. 
      142 subjects completed the protocol. RESULTS: Analysis of the effectiveness of 
      treatment according to the primary criterion showed a better effectiveness of 
      Aducil® as compared with Trental® 400. Subjects who received Aducil® had a higher 
      increase in the absolute maximum walking distance after 12 weeks of treatment as 
      compared with those taking Trental® 400: 126±110 m versus 45±39 m, respectively 
      (р<0.001). Subjects who received Aducil® had a statistically significant 
      improvement in quality of life parameters such as physical and mental health 
      components according to the SF-36 questionnaire after 12 weeks of treatment 
      (р≤0.01). Subjects in Aducil® group had better quality of life with an increase 
      from 34 to 40 points according to the physical component score, while patients in 
      Trental® 400 group demonstrated minor positive changes (from 35 to 37 points); 
      mean mental component score increased from 45 to 48 points in Aducil® group as 
      compared with an increase from 45 to 47 points in Trental® 400 group. While 
      self-reported physical health status was similar between the groups at baseline, 
      subjects in Aducil® group reported better physical functioning after treatment 
      (р=0.016). Two adverse events were registered in two subjects in Aducil® group. 
      CONCLUSION: Analysis of the study endpoints demonstrated that Aducil® had better 
      treatment effectiveness in patients with chronic lower limb ischemia stage IIB 
      according to the classification of A.V. Pokrovsky-Fontaine as compared with 
      Trental® 400, while the safety profile and drug tolerance were similar between 
      the two.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of oral surgery-related tissues from cone beam computed 
      tomography (CBCT) images can significantly accelerate treatment planning and 
      improve surgical accuracy. In this paper, we propose a fully automated tissue 
      segmentation system for dental implant surgery. Specifically, we propose an image 
      preprocessing method based on data distribution histograms, which can adaptively 
      process CBCT images with different parameters. Based on this, we use the bone 
      segmentation network to obtain the segmentation results of alveolar bone, teeth, 
      and maxillary sinus. We use the tooth and mandibular regions as the ROI regions 
      of tooth segmentation and mandibular nerve tube segmentation to achieve the 
      corresponding tasks. The tooth segmentation results can obtain the order 
      information of the dentition. The corresponding experimental results show that 
      our method can achieve higher segmentation accuracy and efficiency compared to 
      existing methods. Its average Dice scores on the tooth, alveolar bone, maxillary 
      sinus, and mandibular canal segmentation tasks were 96.5%, 95.4%, 93.6%, and 
      94.8%, respectively. These results demonstrate that it can accelerate the 
      development of digital dentistry.

TI  - Use of Statins in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: Current 
      Evidence and Perspectives.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25094958 [doi]
LID - 4958
AB  - Systemic inflammation and coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction are 
      essential pathophysiological factors in heart failure (HF) with preserved 
      ejection fraction (HFpEF) that support the use of statins. The pleiotropic 
      properties of statins, such as anti-inflammatory, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, 
      and antioxidant effects, are generally accepted and may be beneficial in HF, 
      especially in HFpEF. Numerous observational clinical trials have consistently 
      shown a beneficial prognostic effect of statins in patients with HFpEF, while the 
      results of two larger trials in patients with HFrEF have been controversial. Such 
      differences may be related to a more pronounced impact of the pleiotropic 
      properties of statins on the pathophysiology of HFpEF and pro-inflammatory 
      comorbidities (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney 
      disease) that are more common in HFpEF. This review discusses the potential 
      mechanisms of statin action that may be beneficial for patients with HFpEF, as 
      well as clinical trials that have evaluated the statin effects on left 
      ventricular diastolic function and clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF.

TI  - In-process monitoring of a tissue-engineered oral mucosa fabricated on a 
      micropatterned collagen scaffold: use of optical coherence tomography for quality 
      control.
PG  - e11468
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11468 [doi]
LID - e11468
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported a novel technique for fabricating 
      dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ)-like micropatterned collagen scaffolds to 
      manufacture an ex vivo produced oral mucosa equivalent (EVPOME) for clinical 
      translation; however, more biomimetic micropatterns are required to promote oral 
      keratinocyte-based tissue engineering/regenerative medicine. In addition, 
      in-process monitoring for quality control of tissue-engineered products is key to 
      successful clinical outcomes. However, evaluating three-dimensional 
      tissue-engineered constructs such as EVPOME is challenging. This study aimed to 
      update our technique to fabricate a more biomimetic DEJ structure of oral mucosa 
      and to investigate the efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 
      combination with deep learning for non-invasive EVPOME monitoring. METHODS: A 
      picosecond laser-textured microstructure mimicking DEJ on stainless steel was 
      used as a negative mould to fabricate the micropatterned collagen scaffold. 
      During EVPOME manufacturing, OCT was applied twice to monitor the EVPOME and 
      evaluate its epithelial thickness. FINDINGS: Our moulding system resulted in 
      successful micropattern replication on the curved collagen scaffold. OCT imaging 
      visualised the epithelial layer and the underlying micropatterned scaffold in 
      EVPOME, enabling to non-invasively detect specific defects not found before the 
      histological examination. Additionally, a gradual increase in epithelial 
      thickness was observed over time. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the 
      feasibility of using a stainless-steel negative mould to create a more biomimetic 
      micropattern on collagen scaffolds and the potential of OCT imaging for quality 
      control in oral keratinocyte-based tissue engineering/regenerative medicine.

TI  - Microbiota and Metabolomic Patterns in the Breast Milk of Subjects with Celiac

LID - 10.3390/nu13072243 [doi]
LID - 2243
AB  - The intestinal microbiome may trigger celiac disease (CD) in individuals with a 
      genetic disposition when exposed to dietary gluten. Research demonstrates that 
      nutrition during infancy is crucial to the intestinal microbiome engraftment. 
      Very few studies to date have focused on the breast milk composition of subjects 
      with a history of CD on a gluten-free diet. Here, we utilize a multi-omics 
      approach with shotgun metagenomics to analyze the breast milk microbiome 
      integrated with metabolome profiling of 36 subjects, 20 with CD on a gluten-free 
      diet and 16 healthy controls. These analyses identified significant differences 
      in bacterial and viral species/strains and functional pathways but no difference 
      in metabolite abundance. Specifically, three bacterial strains with increased 
      abundance were identified in subjects with CD on a gluten-free diet of which one 
      (Rothia mucilaginosa) has been previously linked to autoimmune conditions. We 
      also identified five pathways with increased abundance in subjects with CD on a 
      gluten-free diet. We additionally found four bacterial and two viral 
      species/strains with increased abundance in healthy controls. Overall, the 
      differences observed in bacterial and viral species/strains and in functional 
      pathways observed in our analysis may influence microbiome engraftment in 
      neonates, which may impact their future clinical outcomes.

AB  - Stepped wedge designs are increasingly commonplace and advantageous for cluster 
      randomized trials when it is both unethical to assign placebo, and it is 
      logistically difficult to allocate an intervention simultaneously to many 
      clusters. We study marginal mean models fit with generalized estimating equations 
      for assessing treatment effectiveness in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials. 
      This approach has advantages over the more commonly used mixed models that (1) 
      the population-average parameters have an important interpretation for public 
      health applications and (2) they avoid untestable assumptions on latent variable 
      distributions and avoid parametric assumptions about error distributions, 
      therefore, providing more robust evidence on treatment effects. However, cluster 
      randomized trials typically have a small number of clusters, rendering the 
      standard generalized estimating equation sandwich variance estimator biased and 
      highly variable and hence yielding incorrect inferences. We study the usual 
      asymptotic generalized estimating equation inferences (i.e., using sandwich 
      variance estimators and asymptotic normality) and four small-sample corrections 
      to generalized estimating equation for stepped wedge cluster randomized trials 
      and for parallel cluster randomized trials as a comparison. We show by simulation 
      that the small-sample corrections provide improvement, with one correction 
      appearing to provide at least nominal coverage even with only 10 clusters per 
      group. These results demonstrate the viability of the marginal mean approach for 
      both stepped wedge and parallel cluster randomized trials. We also study the 
      comparative performance of the corrected methods for stepped wedge and parallel 
      designs, and describe how the methods can accommodate interval censoring of 
      individual failure times and incorporate semiparametric efficient estimators.

TI  - Mechanistic correlates of clinical responses to omalizumab in the setting of oral 
      immunotherapy for milk allergy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In our recent clinical trial, the addition of omalizumab to oral 
      immunotherapy (OIT) for milk allergy improved safety, but no significant clinical 
      benefit was detected. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate mechanisms by which 
      omalizumab modulates immunity in the context of OIT and to identify baseline 
      biomarkers that predict subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from 
      omalizumab. METHODS: Blood was obtained at baseline and multiple time points 
      during a placebo-controlled trial of OIT for milk allergy in which subjects were 
      randomized to receive omalizumab or placebo. Immunologic outcomes included 
      measurement of basophil CD63 expression and histamine release and casein-specific 
      CD4(+) regulatory T-cell proliferation. Biomarkers were analyzed in relationship 
      to measurements of safety and efficacy. RESULTS: Milk-induced basophil CD63 
      expression was transiently reduced in whole blood samples from both omalizumab- 
      and placebo-treated subjects. However, IgE-dependent histamine release increased 
      in washed cell preparations from omalizumab- but not placebo-treated subjects. No 
      increase in regulatory T-cell frequency was evident in either group. Subjects 
      with lower rates of adverse reactions, regardless of arm, experienced better 
      clinical outcomes. Pre-OIT basophil reactivity positively associated with 
      occurrence of symptoms during OIT, whereas the baseline milk IgE/total IgE ratio 
      correlated with the likelihood of achieving sustained unresponsiveness. 
      A combination of baseline basophil and serologic biomarkers defined a subset of 
      patients in which adjunctive therapy with omalizumab was associated with 
      attainment of sustained unresponsiveness and a reduction in adverse reactions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Combining omalizumab therapy with milk OIT led to distinct 
      alterations in basophil reactivity but not T-cell responses. Baseline biomarkers 
      can identify subjects most likely to benefit from adjunctive therapy with 
      omalizumab.

TI  - Socioeconomic disadvantage and long-term survival duration in out-of-hospital

AB  - BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) is a well-established determinant of 
      cardiovascular health. However, the relationship between SES and clinical 
      outcomes in long-term out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is less 
      well-understood. The Singapore Housing Index (SHI) is a validated building-level 
      SES indicator. We investigated whether SES as measured by SHI is associated with 
      long-term OHCA survival in Singapore. METHODS: We conducted an open cohort study 
      with linked data from the Singapore Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study 
      (PAROS), and the Singapore Registry of Births and Deaths (SRBD) from 2010 to 
      2020. We fitted generalized structural equation models, calculating hazard ratios 
      (HRs) using a Weibull model. We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 
      calculated the predicted marginal probability for each SHI category. RESULTS: We 
      included 659 cases. In both univariable and multivariable analyses, SHI did not 
      have a significant association with survival. Indirect pathways of SHI mediated 
      through covariates such as Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response time (HR of 
      low-medium, high-medium and high SHI when compared to low SHI: 0.98 (0.88-1.10), 
      1.01 (0.93-1.11), 1.02 (0.93-1.12) respectively), and age of arrest (HR of 
      low-medium, high-medium and high SHI when compared to low SHI: 1.02 (0.75-1.38), 
      1.08 (0.84-1.38), 1.18 (0.91-1.54) respectively) had no significant association 
      with OHCA survival. There was no clear trend in the predicted marginal 
      probability of survival among the different SHI categories. CONCLUSIONS: We did 
      not find a significant association between SES and OHCA survival outcomes in 
      residential areas in Singapore. Among other reasons, this could be due to 
      affordable healthcare across different socioeconomic classes.

AB  - Type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is critical to maintaining antigen-presenting 
      cell function for anti-tumor immunity. However, recent studies have suggested 
      that IFN-I signaling may also contribute to more aggressive phenotypes, raising 
      the possibility that IFN-I downstream signaling in cancer and myeloid cells may 
      exert dichotomous functions.We analyzed the clinicopathologic correlation of 
      cancer-specific IFN-I activation in 195 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
      patients. We also characterized the immune impact of IFN-I receptor 
      (IFNAR1)-deficiency in syngeneic tumor models using biochemistry, flow cytometry, 
      and single-cell RNA-Seq. We stained HNSCC tissue microarrays with a sensitive 
      IFN-I downstream signaling activation marker, MX1, and quantitated cancer 
      cell-specific MX1 staining. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that MX1-high tumors 
      exhibited worse survival, a phenotype that depends on the number of CD8(+) 
      intratumoral T-cells. We found that cancer-specific IFNAR1 engagement promotes 
      cancer stemness and higher expression levels of suppressive immune checkpoint 
      receptor ligands in cancer-derived exosomes. Notably, mice bearing 
      Ifnar1-deficient tumors exhibited lower tumor burden, increased T-cell 
      infiltration, reduced exhausted CD4(+)PD1(high) T-cells, and increased effector 
      population CD8(+)IFN-γ(+) T-cells. Then, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing 
      and discovered that cancer-specific IFN-I signaling not only restricts effector 
      cells expansion but also dampens their functional fitness.The beneficial role of 
      IFN-I activation is largely dependent on the myeloid compartment. Cancer-specific 
      IFN-I receptor engagement promotes cancer stemness and the release of 
      cancer-derived exosomes with high expression levels of immune checkpoint receptor 
      ligands. Cancer-specific IFN-I activation is associated with poor immunogenicity 
      and worse clinical outcomes in HNSCC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) are benign 
      intraosseous cysts with expansive growth. They account for approximately 7.8 % of 
      all jaw cysts and have a high recurrence rate. Herein, we present a minimally 
      invasive approach for the surgical treatment of a remarkable variation of OKC 
      with a 15-year radiological and clinical follow-up. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: We 
      present the case of a 42-year-old female patient with a large cyst in the 
      mandible between teeth 35 and 45, who reported spontaneous swelling and 
      paresthesia of the lower lip. Radiological imaging is crucial for treatment 
      planning. The cyst was surgically treated with a single enucleation combined with 
      adjuvant therapy to minimise recurrence. A titanium plate was inserted because of 
      the size of the defect. Recurrence was observed one year later and treated with 
      single enucleation and adjuvant therapy. After 15 years, complete healing, no 
      signs of recurrence, and complete remodeling of the mandible were observed. 
      CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The treatment of OKC remains the subject of varying 
      approaches in the literature due to the lack of established general guidelines. 
      One treatment option is single enucleation combined with adjuvant therapy to 
      minimise recurrence, which can result in complete clinical and radiological 
      remodeling of the bone. CONCLUSION: Direct enucleation combined with adjuvant 
      therapy is a practical approach for treating large OKCs. It is associated with 
      less morbidity and burden on the patient than enucleation with prior 
      decompression or radical resection. Additionally, it shows no deficits in bone 
      defect healing.

TI  - [Experience in ureteroscopy for managing urolithiasis in one clinic. when does 
      quantity transform into quality?].
PG  - 54-59
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years, there has been an increasing role of ureteroscopy 
      in managing urinary tract calculi of various locations. Several studies have 
      reported the relationship between the efficacy and safety of ureteroscopic 
      interventions and surgeons skills and hospital caseload volume. The aim of our 
      study was to assess the effectiveness of urethroscopic stone removal, the changes 
      in treatment effectiveness, frequency and types of complications along with 
      gaining experience in these interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 
      4031 urolithiasis patients who were admitted to our urological department and 
      underwent ureteroscopy from 2001 to 2013. To determine the effectiveness and 
      safety of the method, as the experience gained, the time of observation was 
      divided into three periods: from 2000 to 2004, from 2004 to 2009, from 2009 to 
      2013. The parameters were evaluated for the entire observation time and for each 
      period. RESULTS: Complete fragmentation of the stones was observed in 3628 (90%) 
      patients, partial - in 219 (5.4%). No treatment effect was observed in 138 (3.4%) 
      patients. The greatest effectiveness (96.94%) was seen in stones in the lower 
      third of the ureter. The proportion of unsuccessful ureteroscopies was 5.7%, 4.5% 
      and 3.5% for the periods 2000 -2004, 2005-2009 and 2009-2013, respectively 
      (p=0.027). The incidence of acute postoperative pyelonephritis in the 
      corresponding periods was 15.4%, 3.3% and 2.9% (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Ureteroscopy is an effective and safe treatment modality for managing upper 
      urinary tract calculi. It is most effective in treating distal ureteral stones. 
      The increase in the treatment effectiveness and the reduction in the incidence of 
      complications along with gaining experience, suggests that these interventions 
      should be practiced mainly in urology centers specializing in the care of 
      patients with urolithiasis.

TI  - Development and validation of a multivariable model for prediction of malignant 
      transformation and recurrence of oral epithelial dysplasia.
PG  - 1599-1607
LID - 10.1038/s41416-023-02438-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is the precursor to oral squamous 
      cell carcinoma which is amongst the top ten cancers worldwide. Prognostic 
      significance of conventional histological features in OED is not well 
      established. Many additional histological abnormalities are seen in OED, but are 
      insufficiently investigated, and have not been correlated to clinical outcomes. 
      METHODS: A digital quantitative analysis of epithelial cellularity, nuclear 
      geometry, cytoplasm staining intensity and epithelial architecture/thickness is 
      conducted on 75 OED whole-slide images (252 regions of interest) with 
      feature-specific comparisons between grades and against non-dysplastic/control 
      cases. Multivariable models were developed to evaluate prediction of OED 
      recurrence and malignant transformation. The best performing models were 
      externally validated on unseen cases pooled from four different centres 
      (n = 121), of which 32% progressed to cancer, with an average transformation time 
      of 45 months. RESULTS: Grade-based differences were seen for cytoplasmic eosin, 
      nuclear eccentricity, and circularity in basal epithelial cells of OED 
      (p < 0.05). Nucleus circularity was associated with OED recurrence (p = 0.018) 
      and epithelial perimeter associated with malignant transformation (p = 0.03). The 
      developed model demonstrated superior predictive potential for malignant 
      transformation (AUROC 0.77) and OED recurrence (AUROC 0.74) as compared with 
      conventional WHO grading (AUROC 0.68 and 0.71, respectively). External validation 
      supported the prognostic strength of this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports 
      a novel prognostic model which outperforms existing grading systems. Further 
      studies are warranted to evaluate its significance for OED prognostication.

AB  - Anxiety sensitivity, or fear of anxious arousal, is cross-sectionally associated 
      with a wide array of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae, including 
      symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, sleep 
      disturbance, pain, and somatization. The current study utilizes a large-scale, 
      multi-site, prospective study of trauma survivors presenting to emergency 
      departments. Hypotheses tested whether elevated anxiety sensitivity in the 
      immediate posttrauma period is associated with more severe and persistent 
      trajectories of common adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae in the 
      eight weeks posttrauma. Participants from the AURORA study (n = 2,269 recruited 
      from 23 emergency departments) completed self-report assessments over eight weeks 
      posttrauma. Associations between heightened anxiety sensitivity and more severe 
      and/or persistent trajectories of trauma-related symptoms identified by growth 
      mixture modeling were analyzed. Anxiety sensitivity assessed two weeks posttrauma 
      was associated with severe and/or persistent posttraumatic stress, depression, 
      anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and somatic symptoms in the eight weeks 
      posttrauma. Effect sizes were in the small to medium range in multivariate models 
      accounting for various demographic, trauma-related, pre-trauma mental 
      health-related, and personality-related factors. Anxiety sensitivity may be a 
      useful transdiagnostic risk factor in the immediate posttraumatic period 
      identifying individuals at risk for the development of adverse posttraumatic 
      neuropsychiatric sequelae. Further, considering anxiety sensitivity is malleable 
      via brief intervention, it could be a useful secondary prevention target. Future 
      research should continue to evaluate associations between anxiety sensitivity and 
      trauma-related pathology.

      outcomes were calculated using the following cut-offs: Clinically significant new 
      or worsening pain = increased pain from pre-to posttrauma by ≥ 2 points on the 
      pain numeric rating scale (Bijur et al., 2003); PTSD ≥31 on the Posttraumatic 
      Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL; Weathers et al., 2013); Depression ≥60 on the 
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS; Cella et al., 
      2010); Insomnia = Insomnia Severity Index scores of at least 15 (Morin et al., 
      2011). Of note, a brief PROMIS anxiety scale was administered, precluding the 
      ability to assess clinically significant symptoms based on typical cut-off 
      scores. Thus, means for anxiety are reported (range = 0–16).

TI  - A Socket Seal Technique With the Use of Autologous Dental Roots for Socket Seal: 
      A Case Series.
PG  - 473-484
LID - 10.1563/aaid-joi-D-21-00279 [doi]
AB  - The literature identified variations in socket seal surgery, each with 
      limitations. This case series aimed to observe the outcome of using autologous 
      dental root (ADR) for socket sealing on socket preservation (SP). A total of 9 
      patients with 15 extraction sockets were documented. After flapless extraction, 
      the xenograft or alloplastic grafts were placed in the sockets. Autologous dental 
      roots were prepared extraorally and applied to seal the socket entrance. All SP 
      sites healed uneventfully. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was 
      performed after 4-6 months of healing to evaluate ridge dimensions. The preserved 
      alveolar ridge profiles were verified on CBCT scans and during implant surgery. 
      Implants were placed successfully with a reduced need for guided bone 
      regeneration. Histological biopsy specimens were examined in 3 cases. The 
      histological examination demonstrated vital bone formation and osseointegration 
      of graft particles. All patients completed the final restorations and were 
      monitored for 15.56 ± 9.08 months after functional loading. The favorable 
      clinical outcomes support the use of ADR for SP procedures. It was not only 
      accepted to patients but also easy to perform with low complication rates. The 
      ADR technique is thus a feasible method for socket seal surgery.

TI  - Differences in In Vitro Properties of Pancreatin Preparations for Pancreatic 
      Exocrine Insufficiency as Marketed in Russia and CIS.
PG  - 369-376
LID - 10.1007/s40268-020-00326-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic enzyme-replacement therapy (PERT), provided as pancreatin 
      to patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI), is considered an 
      essential substitute for the pivotal physiological function the pancreas fulfills 
      in digestion. PEI involves a reduction in the synthesis and secretion of 
      pancreatic enzymes (lipase, protease, amylase), which leads to an inadequate 
      enzymatic response to a meal and consequently to maldigestion and malabsorption 
      of nutrients. The efficacy of PERT is strongly dependent on enzyme activity, 
      dissolution, and pancreatin particle size. OBJECTIVE: The physiological 
      properties of eight pancreatin preparations (nine batches; five different brands) 
      available in Russia and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States: Armenia, 
      Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, 
      Uzbekistan) were investigated. METHODS: The lipase activity, dissolution, and 
      particle size distribution of samples from multiple batches of pancreatin of 
      different strengths were measured. RESULTS: Regarding lipase activities, all 
      pancreatin preparations except Micrazim® matched the labeled content. 
      Considerable differences were observed in particle size and dissolution. 
      CONCLUSION: Pancreatin preparations available in Russia and CIS demonstrate 
      product-to-product and batch-to-batch variability regarding the measured 
      properties of lipase activity, dissolution, and particle size. This may impact 
      the efficacy of PERT and therefore clinical outcomes.

      ribavirin in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infected with HCV genotype 2].
PG  - 84-85
LID - 10.17116/terarkh201688584-85 [doi]
AB  - The paper describes a case of ineffective dual antiviral therapy (pegylated 
      interferon and ribavirin) in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infected with 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 according to the data from the use of a 
      commercial test system. Analysis of the predictors of failure of antiviral 
      therapy (AVT) (the HCV recombinant variant RF2k/1b, a high viral load before the 
      start of therapy, an unfavorable IL-28B genotype, a high body mass index, and a 
      need for a lower ribavirin dose after 12 weeks of AVT because of adverse 
      reactions for less than 4 weeks) in this patient has shown that no virological 
      response is mainly associated with the presence of the HCV recombinant variant, 
      the treatment effectiveness of which is comparable with that in HCV genotype 1 
      and obesity. In this connection, when HCV genotype 2 is identified, sequencing 
      the NS5B region of the HCV genome is additionally recommended to rule out the 
      virus recombinant strain and, if it is detected, highly effective interferon-free 
      therapy with direct-acting antivirals is indicated.
