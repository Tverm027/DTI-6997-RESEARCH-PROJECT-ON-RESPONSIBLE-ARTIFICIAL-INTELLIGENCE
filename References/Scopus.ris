AB  - Objectives: This study aims to explore and discuss recent advancements in tooth reconstruction utilizing deep learning (DL) techniques. A review on new DL methodologies in partial and full tooth reconstruction is conducted. Data/Sources: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for articles from 2003 to 2023. Study selection: The review includes 9 articles published from 2018 to 2023. The selected articles showcase novel DL approaches for tooth reconstruction, while those concentrating solely on the application or review of DL methods are excluded. The review shows that data is acquired via intraoral scans or laboratory scans of dental plaster models. Common data representations are depth maps, point clouds, and voxelized point clouds. Reconstructions focus on single teeth, using data from adjacent teeth or the entire jaw. Some articles include antagonist teeth data and features like occlusal grooves and gap distance. Primary network architectures include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers. Compared to conventional digital methods, DL-based tooth reconstruction reports error rates approximately two times lower. Conclusions: Generative DL models analyze dental datasets to reconstruct missing teeth by extracting insights into patterns and structures. Through specialized application, these models reconstruct morphologically and functionally sound dental structures, leveraging information from the existing teeth. The reported advancements facilitate the feasibility of DL-based dental crown reconstruction. Beyond GANs and Transformers with point clouds or voxels, recent studies indicate promising outcomes with diffusion-based architectures and innovative data representations like wavelets for 3D shape completion and inference problems. Clinical significance: Generative network architectures employed in the analysis and reconstruction of dental structures demonstrate notable proficiency. The enhanced accuracy and efficiency of DL-based frameworks hold the potential to enhance clinical outcomes and increase patient satisfaction. The reduced reconstruction times and diminished requirement for manual intervention may lead to cost savings and improved accessibility of dental services. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Digital Smile Design (DSD) is used in many fields of dentistry. This prospective observational study assessed laypeople’s and dental professionals’ perceptions of a DSD application. SmileCloud, an online DSD platform, was used to create two different designs for three patients; after that, the participants, in a 30-question online illustrated survey, were asked about the most attractive design and other features of the smile. Dentists’ and laypeople’s perceptions about specific DSD features were assessed. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test was used. Descriptive and crosstab analyses compared the respondents’ opinions for each statement. Chi-square tests were used to determine the relationship between the questions and any association with age, gender, and profession. The test results were rated as significant at a p-value < 0.05. A total of 520 participants (dental professionals, students, dental technicians, and laypeople) were enrolled. The statistically significant features were self-esteem related to appearance (p = 0.05), facial and smile symmetry (p = 0.42, p < 0.0001), tooth color (p = 0.012), and symmetry of gums (p < 0.001). For each patient, the design with dominant round upper incisors and perfect symmetry was preferred (p < 0.001). Digital pre-visualization benefits diagnosis and enriches treatment planning. The dentist–dental technician–patient team should be involved in the decision-making process of pre-visualization. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To describe a strategy using digital technologies for improving the diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical execution of patients with excessive gingival display (EGD) due to altered passive eruption (APE). Clinical Considerations: An important component for successful patient's management is to fulfill their esthetic expectations whilst delivering predictable and long-term therapeutic outcomes. To achieve this goal in patients with excessive gingival display due to altered passive eruption, it is essential to perform an accurate diagnosis and to communicate to the patient the expected customized results using digital technologies. Computer-aided designed and manufactured multifunctional anatomical prototypes (MAPs) may contribute to these purposes. Additionally, they can guide the surgical crown lengthening procedure or serve as a reference during the surgical guide fabrication providing information of the required anatomical landmarks. Conclusions: This novel strategy protocol for diagnosis, communication, and treatment management of patients with excessive gingival display follows functional and biological principles within the frame of a digital workflow, which improves the diagnostic capabilities, enhances communication, and guides the surgical treatment as shown in the 12 months follow-up of the reported case. Clinical Significance: Developing a virtual patient by combining multiple digital data sets including cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), intra-oral scans and digital photography, supports the clinician and the patient to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis and to better communicate the expected results to the patient. Furthermore, this digital treatment exercise based on anatomical and biological principles will facilitate the surgical precision and the achievement of successful outcomes, thus fulfilling the patient needs and expectations. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has transformed various medical specialties, including orthodontics. AI has shown promising results in enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses, treatment planning, and predicting treatment outcomes. Its usage in orthodontic practices worldwide has increased with the availability of various AI applications and tools. This review explores the principles of AI, its applications in orthodontics, and its implementation in clinical practice. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on AI applications in dental diagnostics, cephalometric evaluation, skeletal age determination, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) evaluation, decision making, and patient telemonitoring. Due to study heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was possible. AI has demonstrated high efficacy in all these areas, but variations in performance and the need for manual supervision suggest caution in clinical settings. The complexity and unpredictability of AI algorithms call for cautious implementation and regular manual validation. Continuous AI learning, proper governance, and addressing privacy and ethical concerns are crucial for successful integration into orthodontic practice. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate and automatic segmentation of individual tooth and root canal from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is an essential but challenging step for dental surgical planning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, which consists of two neural networks, DentalNet and PulpNet, for efficient, precise, and fully automatic tooth instance segmentation and root canal segmentation from CBCT images. We first use the proposed DentalNet to achieve tooth instance segmentation and identification. Then, the region of interest (ROI) of the affected tooth is extracted and fed into the PulpNet to obtain precise segmentation of the pulp chamber and the root canal space. These two networks are trained by multi-task feature learning and evaluated on two clinical datasets respectively and achieve superior performances to several comparing methods. In addition, we incorporate our method into an efficient clinical workflow to improve the surgical planning process. In two clinical case studies, our workflow took only 2 min instead of 6 h to obtain the 3D model of tooth and root canal effectively for the surgical planning, resulting in satisfying outcomes in difficult root canal treatments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental health issues are on the rise, necessitating prompt and precise diagnosis. Automated dental condition classification can support this need. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning methods and multimodal feature fusion techniques in advancing the field of automated dental condition classification. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A dataset of 11,653 clinically sourced images representing six prevalent dental conditions-caries, calculus, gingivitis, tooth discoloration, ulcers, and hypodontia-was utilized. Features were extracted using five Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, then fused into a matrix. Classification models were constructed using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, recall rate, precision, and Kappa index. RESULTS: The SVM classifier integrated with feature fusion demonstrated superior performance with a Kappa index of 0.909 and accuracy of 0.925. This significantly surpassed individual CNN models such as EfficientNetB0, which achieved a Kappa of 0.814 and accuracy of 0.847. CONCLUSIONS: The amalgamation of feature fusion with advanced machine learning algorithms can significantly bolster the precision and robustness of dental condition classification systems. Such a method presents a valuable tool for dental professionals, facilitating enhanced diagnostic accuracy and subsequently improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: The fields of medicine and dentistry are beginning to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diagnostics. This may reduce subjectivity and improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment planning. Current evidence on pathosis detection on Pantomographs(PGs) indicates the presence or absence of disease in the entire radiographic image, with little evidence of the relation of periapical pathosis to the causative tooth. Objective: To develop a Deep Learning (DL) AI model for the segmentation of periapical pathosis and its relation to teeth on PGs. Method: 250 PGs were manually annotated by subject experts to lay down the ground truth for training AI algorithms on the segmentation of periapical pathosis. Two approaches were used for lesion detection: Multi-models 1 and 2, using U-net and Mask RCNN algorithms, respectively. The resulting segmented lesions generated on the testing data set were superimposed with results of teeth segmentation and numbering algorithms trained separately to relate lesions to causative teeth. Hence, both multi-model approaches related periapical pathosis to the causative teeth on PGs. Results: The performance metrics of lesion segmentation carried out by U-net are as follows: Accuracy = 98.1%, precision = 84.5%, re-call = 80.3%, F-1 score = 82.2%, dice index = 75.2%, and Intersection over Union = 67.6%. Mask RCNN carried out lesion segmentation with an accuracy of 46.7%, precision of 80.6%, recall of 55%, and F-1 score of 63.1%. Conclusion: In this study, the multi-model approach successfully related periapical pathosis to the causative tooth on PGs. However, U-net outperformed Mask RCNN in the tasks performed, suggesting that U-net will remain the standard for medical image segmentation tasks. Further training of the models on other findings and an increased number of images will lead to the automation of the detection of common radiographic findings in the dental diagnostic workflow. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Dental implant placement is a critical procedure in modern dentistry, requiring precise treatment planning to ensure successful outcomes. Traditionally, treatment planning has relied on the expertise of clinicians, but recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up the possibility of AI‑assisted treatment planning. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients requiring dental implant placement were included in this comparative study. For each patient, a clinical treatment plan was created by an experienced dentist, while an AI algorithm, trained on a dataset of implant placement cases, generated an alternative plan. Various parameters, including implant position, angulation, and depth, were compared between the two plans. Surgical templates were fabricated based on both plans to guide implant placement accurately. Results: The results of this study indicate that AI‑generated treatment plans closely align with clinical plans in terms of implant positioning, angulation, and depth. Mean discrepancies of less than 1 mm and 2 degrees were observed for implant position and angulation, respectively, between the two planning methods. The AI‑generated plans also showed a reduction in planning time, averaging 10 min compared to the clinical planning, which averaged 30 min per case. Additionally, the surgical templates based on AI‑generated plans exhibited similar accuracy in implant placement as those based on clinical plans. Conclusion: AI‑assisted treatment planning for dental implant placement demonstrates promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - We present a very rare case of a child with nine supernumerary teeth to analyze the potential, benefits, and limitations of artificial intelligence, as well as two commercial tools for tooth segmentation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding applications in dentistry today, particularly in radiography. Special attention is given to models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and their application in automatic segmentation of the oral cavity and tooth structures. The integration of AI is gaining increasing attention, and the automation of the detection and localization of supernumerary teeth can accelerate the treatment planning process. Despite advancements in 3D segmentation techniques, relying on trained professionals remains crucial. Therefore, human expertise should remain key, and AI should be seen as a support rather than a replacement. Generally, a comprehensive tool that can satisfy all clinical needs in terms of supernumerary teeth and their segmentation is not yet available, so it is necessary to incorporate multiple tools into practice. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dentists' knowledge, attitude and perception of robotics(R) and artificial intelligence (AI). METHODOLOGY: Data were gathered for this cross-sectional survey from dental schools in Karachi that were both public and private. A total of 550 surveys were delivered through Google Forms. Dental students, graduates, postgraduates, and professionals of both sexes aged 20-70 years were included. Participants were chosen by convenience sampling using non-probability. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and the Chi-square test in SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS: Of the 550 participants, men comprised 33% (n=181) overall, while women comprised 67%(n= 369). Despite having a great understanding of AI and R, the majority of participants, 55.1%(n=304), also have a strong point of view. However, only 42.5%(n=234) of respondents were aware of the difference between AI and R and 55.2%(n=304) have prior knowledge about AI and R. Nevertheless, 58% (n=319) of dentists thought it would be helpful for future dental procedures. Only 16%(n=88) of respondents believe artificial intelligence will eventually replace dentists. Some applicants, 55.2%(n=304), proposed employing AI/R for therapy, and 51%(n=281) agreed to get treatment. CONCLUSION: By evaluating dentists' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of these technologies, it is possible to understand better the implementation of robotics and AI in clinical practice. More education and training programmes for dental professionals would be beneficial, and more studies would be able to determine the best ways to integrate robotics and AI to enhance patient results. © 2024, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences.

AB  - Purpose: To describe and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various dental caries diagnostic techniques, including the use of intraoral scanners for caries diagnosis based on near-infrared imaging (NIR) technology. Material and Methods: A MEDLINE search from 1980–2023 focused on dental caries diagnostic techniques, emphasizing intraoral scanners using NIR technology. Alternative caries detection methods were also evaluated for their advantages and limitations, enabling a comparison with NIR. The review included traditional caries tools, the latest detection methods, and NIR's role in intraoral scanners, drawing from case reports and both in vivo and in vitro studies. Keywords like “caries detection,” “intraoral scanners,” and “Near Infrared Imaging (NIRI)” guided the search. After screening titles and abstracts for relevance, full texts with valuable insights were thoroughly analyzed. The data was grouped into three: traditional diagnostics, advanced digital methods, and intraoral scanner-based detection. Results: This comprehensive narrative review described and discussed the current state of dental caries diagnostic methods, given the insufficient number of clinical investigations suitable for a systematic review. Traditional caries diagnosis techniques have shown variable accuracy dependent on a dentist's experience and the potential over-removal of healthy tooth structures. Intraoral scanners have emerged as a novel caries detection method, because of their integration of NIR technology. Various studies have confirmed the efficacy of NIR in detecting interproximal caries and in the early diagnosis of non-cavitated caries. Specifically, intraoral scanners have demonstrated promising results, proving comparable to established diagnostic methods like bitewing radiography. Nevertheless, while the integration of NIR into intraoral scanners seems promising, the technology still faces challenges, notably its accuracy in detecting secondary and subgingival cavities. However, with anticipated integrations of AI, NIR in intraoral scanners could revolutionize early caries detection. Conclusions: Intraoral scanners with NIR technology offer non-destructive imaging, real-time lesion visuals, and enhanced patient communication. Although comparable to bitewing radiography in some studies, a universally accepted diagnostic tool is lacking. Future research should compare them with existing methods, focusing on clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptance. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Furcation defects pose a significant challenge in the diagnosis and treatment planning of periodontal diseases. The accurate detection of furcation involvements (FI) on periapical radiographs (PAs) is crucial for the success of periodontal therapy. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach to furcation defect detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an accuracy rate of 95%. This research has undergone a rigorous review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has received accreditation under number 202002030B0C505. A dataset of 300 periapical radiographs of teeth with and without FI were collected and preprocessed to enhance the quality of the images. The efficient and innovative image masking technique used in this research better enhances the contrast between FI symptoms and other areas. Moreover, this technology highlights the region of interest (ROI) for the subsequent CNN models training with a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. The proposed segmentation algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance with an overall accuracy up to 94.97%, surpassing other conventional methods. Moreover, in comparison with existing CNN technology for identifying dental problems, this research proposes an improved adaptive threshold preprocessing technique that produces clearer distinctions between teeth and interdental molars. The proposed model achieves impressive results in detecting FI with identification rates ranging from 92.96% to a remarkable 94.97%. These findings suggest that our deep learning approach holds significant potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of dental diagnosis. Such AI-assisted dental diagnosis has the potential to improve periodontal diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. This research demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using deep learning algorithms for furcation defect detection on periapical radiographs and highlights the potential for AI-assisted dental diagnosis. With the improvement of dental abnormality detection, earlier intervention could be enabled and could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: This article reviews recent advances in computer-aided segmentation methods for oral and maxillofacial surgery and describes the advantages and limitations of these methods. The objective is to provide an invaluable resource for precise therapy and surgical planning in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Study selection, data and sources: This review includes full-text articles and conference proceedings reporting the application of segmentation methods in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The research focuses on three aspects: tooth detection segmentation, mandibular canal segmentation and alveolar bone segmentation. The most commonly used imaging technique is CBCT, followed by conventional CT and Orthopantomography. A systematic electronic database search was performed up to July 2023 (Medline via PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ArXiv, Google Scholar were searched). Results: These segmentation methods can be mainly divided into two categories: traditional image processing and machine learning (including deep learning). Performance testing on a dataset of images labeled by medical professionals shows that it performs similarly to dentists' annotations, confirming its effectiveness. However, no studies have evaluated its practical application value. Conclusion: Segmentation methods (particularly deep learning methods) have demonstrated unprecedented performance, while inherent challenges remain, including the scarcity and inconsistency of datasets, visible artifacts in images, unbalanced data distribution, and the “black box” nature. Clinical significance: Accurate image segmentation is critical for precise treatment and surgical planning in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This review aims to facilitate more accurate and effective surgical treatment planning among dental researchers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the results after selective sinus replacement (SSR) for aortic root remodeling in bicuspid aortopathy. Methods: Among 662 patients who underwent root repair using SSR between 2005 and 2020, there were 114 with bicuspid aortopathy. SSR was performed either as an isolated procedure (31) or as an adjunct to aortic valve repair (83) and was adjusted to the existing aortic annulus diameter rather than a downsized diameter. In valves with asymmetrical commissural orientation, the repair aimed for the achievement of a 180°-commissural orientation. Results: Abolishment of aortic insufficiency (AI) ≥2+ using root repair alone was only possible in 2 patients with acute-dissection-related AI, yet isolated root repair was also performed in 29 further patients with no/mild AI. All remaining patients with AI ≥2+ presented cusp-related regurgitation and necessitated an additional valve repair. During the mean follow-up of 91 months (range, 13-196), a relevant valve defect (AI ≥3+ in 8, stenosis in 2) occurred in 10 patients (all after combined repair) resulting in an estimated freedom from a relevant aortic valve defect and/or reoperation of 96 ± 2%, 89 ± 4%, and 82 ± 6% at 5, 10, and 12 years, respectively. Echocardiographically, no patient revealed a considerable change of form or size of the repaired root nor was any root reintervention necessary. Conclusions: Patient-tailored root repair using SSR is a very effective and durable valve-sparing approach for bicuspid aortopathy. Aortic cusp repair is decisive for both abolishment of AI in bicuspid aortopathy and for the functional durability of the repaired aortic valve. © 2022 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery

AB  - Objective: To provide technical and clinical recommendations for implementing a digital workflow in Static Computer-Aided Implant Surgery in the anterior maxilla. Clinical Considerations: An optimal 3D implant position is crucial for achieving satisfying results in implant rehabilitation in the esthetic area. Due to its complexity, implant placement in the esthetic zone should be executed with precision and predictability. Static Computer-Aided Implant Surgery requires thorough planning and detailed attention to every step of the digital workflow protocol. Conclusions: Implant positioning in the esthetic zone using Static Computer-Aided Implant Surgery is a technique-sensitive procedure that requires precise execution of each step. This approach ensures accurate prosthetically driven 3D implant placement and prevents potential errors that could lead to inaccurate positioning. Clinical Significance: The proper implementation of Static Computer-Aided Implant Surgery may increase the level of agreement between the planned and definitive implant 3D positions in the esthetic zone, thus enhancing the esthetic outcomes of implant rehabilitation. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is being increasingly used in Orthodontics and craniofacial health for predicting clinical outcomes. Current ML/AI models are prone to accentuate racial disparities. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of how AI/ML models perpetuate racial biases and how we can mitigate this situation. A narrative review of articles published in the medical literature on racial biases and the use of AI/ML models was undertaken. Current AI/ML models are built on homogenous clinical datasets that have a gross underrepresentation of historically disadvantages demographic groups, especially the ethno-racial minorities. The consequence of such AI/ML models is that they perform poorly when deployed on ethno-racial minorities thus further amplifying racial biases. Healthcare providers, policymakers, AI developers and all stakeholders should pay close attention to various steps in the pipeline of building AI/ML models and every effort must be made to establish algorithmic fairness to redress inequities. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The objective: This study aims to propose a new model to predict the specific treatment effectiveness at site level by analyzing massive amounts of periodontal clinical data with deep learning methods. The background data discussing the present status of the field: In light of the low accuracy of current tools, the proposed models cannot fully meet the needs of clinical effectiveness prediction and cannot be applied to on site level prognosis development and formulation of specific treatment plan. Materials and Methods: Periodontal examination data of 9273 Chinese patients were extracted and used to propose a Sequence-to-Sequence model after performing data management and reconstruction. The model was optimized by introducing the Attention mechanism. Results: In the test set, the model obtained an average site-level probing depth (PD) accuracy (defined as the proportion of sites with <1 mm deviation of the predicted result from the true value) of 92.4% and high sensitivity (98.6%) for the pocket closure variable. For sites with baseline PD <5 mm, the model achieved a prediction accuracy of 94.6%, while it decreased to 79.9% at sites with PD ≥5 mm. In contrast, for teeth with initial mean PD ≥5 mm, the prediction accuracy significantly differed between molars and non-molars. Conclusion: Our model is the first to predict the site-level effectiveness with high accuracy and sensitivity. Future prediction models should incorporate deep learning for improved clinical prediction. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical field has the potential to bring about significant improvements in patient care and outcomes. AI is being used in dentistry and more specifically in orthodontics through the development of diagnostic imaging tools, the development of treatment planning tools, and the development of robotic surgery. The aim of this study is to present the latest emerging AI softwares and applications in dental field to benefit from. Types of studies reviewed: Search strategies were conducted in three electronic databases, with no date limits in the following databases up to April 30, 2023: MEDLINE, PUBMED, and GOOGLE® SCHOLAR for articles related to AI in dentistry & orthodontics. No inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for the selection of the articles. Most of the articles included (n = 79) are reviews of the literature, retro/prospective studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and observational studies. Results: The use of AI in dentistry and orthodontics is a rapidly growing area of research and development, with the potential to revolutionize the field and bring about significant improvements in patient care and outcomes; this can save clinicians’ chair-time and push for more individualized treatment plans. Results from the various studies reported in this review are suggestive that the accuracy of AI-based systems is quite promising and reliable. Practical implications: AI application in the healthcare field has proven to be efficient and helpful for the dentist to be more precise in diagnosis and clinical decision-making. These systems can simplify the tasks and provide results in quick time which can save dentists time and help them perform their duties more efficiently. These systems can be of greater aid and can be used as auxiliary support for dentists with lesser experience. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Deep learning and diagnostic applications in oral and dental health have received significant attention recently. In this review, studies applying deep learning to diagnose anomalies and diseases in dental image material were systematically compiled, and their datasets, methodologies, test processes, explainable artificial intelligence methods, and findings were analyzed. Tests and results in studies involving human-artificial intelligence comparisons are discussed in detail to draw attention to the clinical importance of deep learning. In addition, the review critically evaluates the literature to guide and further develop future studies in this field. An extensive literature search was conducted for the 2019–May 2023 range using the Medline (PubMed) and Google Scholar databases to identify eligible articles, and 101 studies were shortlisted, including applications for diagnosing dental anomalies (n = 22) and diseases (n = 79) using deep learning for classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. According to the results, the most commonly used task type was classification (n = 51), the most commonly used dental image material was panoramic radiographs (n = 55), and the most frequently used performance metric was sensitivity/recall/true positive rate (n = 87) and accuracy (n = 69). Dataset sizes ranged from 60 to 12,179 images. Although deep learning algorithms are used as individual or at least individualized architectures, standardized architectures such as pre-trained CNNs, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and U-Net have been used in most studies. Few studies have used the explainable AI method (n = 22) and applied tests comparing human and artificial intelligence (n = 21). Deep learning is promising for better diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry based on the high-performance results reported by the studies. For all that, their safety should be demonstrated using a more reproducible and comparable methodology, including tests with information about their clinical applicability, by defining a standard set of tests and performance metrics. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that describes the research and development of simulated human intelligent behavior in machines. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that refers to the computer's ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In ML, different models generally fall into three different categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Deep learning is the most recent subset of ML, with networks capable of learning unsupervised from unstructured data. This chapter provides an overview of various AI-based applications in orthodontics, introduces the concept of "blockchain" and its potential applications in healthcare, and briefly discusses the ethical implications of using AI technology. AI-based cephalometric analysis is one of the most common applications of AI in orthodontics. Dentofacial orthopedic and orthodontic treatment planning is primarily influenced by the pubertal growth spurt and skeletal maturation. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objective. Accurate segmentation of various anatomical structures from dental panoramic radiographs is essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of various diseases in digital dentistry. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for accurate and fully automatic segmentation of the maxillary sinus, mandibular condyle, mandibular nerve, alveolar bone and teeth on panoramic radiographs. Approach. A two-stage coarse-to-fine prior-guided segmentation framework is proposed to segment multiple structures on dental panoramic radiographs. In the coarse stage, a multi-label segmentation network is used to generate the coarse segmentation mask, and in the fine-tuning stage, a prior-guided attention network with an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to precisely predict the mask of each anatomical structure. First, a prior-guided edge fusion module is incorporated into the network at the input of each convolution level of the encode path to generate edge-enhanced image feature maps. Second, a prior-guided spatial attention module is proposed to guide the network to extract relevant spatial features from foreground regions based on the combination of the prior information and the spatial attention mechanism. Finally, a prior-guided hybrid attention module is integrated at the bottleneck of the network to explore global context from both spatial and category perspectives. Main results. We evaluated the segmentation performance of our method on a testing dataset that contains 150 panoramic radiographs collected from real-world clinical scenarios. The segmentation results indicate that our proposed method achieves more accurate segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. The average Jaccard scores are 87.91%, 85.25%, 63.94%, 93.46% and 88.96% for the maxillary sinus, mandibular condyle, mandibular nerve, alveolar bone and teeth, respectively. Significance. The proposed method was able to accurately segment multiple structures on panoramic radiographs. This method has the potential to be part of the process of automatic pathology diagnosis from dental panoramic radiographs. © 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine

AB  - Objectives This study evaluated the accuracy of deep neural patchworks (DNPs), a deep learning-based segmentation framework, for automated identification of 60 cephalometric landmarks (bone-, soft tissue- and tooth-landmarks) on CT scans. The aim was to determine whether DNP could be used for routine three-dimensional cephalometric analysis in diagnostics and treatment planning in orthognathic surgery and orthodontics. Methods: Full skull CT scans of 30 adult patients (18 female, 12 male, mean age 35.6 years) were randomly divided into a training and test data set (each n = 15). Clinician A annotated 60 landmarks in all 30 CT scans. Clinician B annotated 60 landmarks in the test data set only. The DNP was trained using spherical segmentations of the adjacent tissue for each landmark. Automated landmark predictions in the separate test data set were created by calculating the center of mass of the predictions. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing these annotations to the manual annotations. Results: The DNP was successfully trained to identify all 60 landmarks. The mean error of our method was 1.94 mm (SD 1.45 mm) compared to a mean error of 1.32 mm (SD 1.08 mm) for manual annotations. The minimum error was found for landmarks ANS 1.11 mm, SN 1.2 mm, and CP_R 1.25 mm. Conclusion: The DNP-algorithm was able to accurately identify cephalometric landmarks with mean errors <2 mm. This method could improve the workflow of cephalometric analysis in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Low training requirements while still accomplishing high precision make this method particularly promising for clinical use. © 2023 British Institute of Radiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pedodontists and general practitioners may need support in planning the early orthodontic treatment of patients with mixed dentition, especially in borderline cases. The use of machine learning algorithms is required to be able to consistently make treatment decisions for such cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use machine learning algorithms to facilitate the process of deciding whether to choose serial extraction or expansion of maxillary and mandibular dental arches for early treatment of borderline patients suffering from moderate to severe crowding. METHODS: The dataset of 116 patients who were previously treated by senior orthodontists and divided into two groups according to their treatment modalities were examined. Machine Learning algorithms including Multilayer Perceptron, Linear Logistic Regression, k-nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest were trained on this dataset. Several metrics were used for the evaluation of accuracy, precision, recall, and kappa statistic. RESULTS: The most important 12 features were determined with the feature selection algorithm. While all algorithms achieved over 90% accuracy, Random Forest yielded 95% accuracy, with high reliability values (kappa = 0.90). CONCLUSION: The employment of machine learning methods for the treatment decision with or without extraction in the early treatment of patients in the mixed dentition can be particularly useful for pedodontists and general practitioners.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

AB  - The majority of patients strongly favor the use of aligners in the present time, especially with the advancement in esthetic dentistry. Today’s market is flooded with aligner companies, many of which share the same therapeutic ethos. We therefore carried out a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate research that had looked at various aligner materials and attachments and their effect on orthodontic tooth movement in relevant studies. A total of 634 papers were discovered after a thorough search of online journals using keywords such as “Aligners”, “Orthodontics”, “Orthodontic attachments”, “Orthodontic tooth movement”, and “Polyethylene” across databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane. The authors individually and in parallel carried out the database investigation, removal of duplicate studies, data extraction, and bias risk. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the type of aligner material had a significant impact on orthodontic tooth movement. The low level of heterogeneity and significant overall effect further support this finding. However, there was little effect of attachment size or shape on tooth mobility. The examined materials were primarily concerned with influencing the physical/physicochemical characteristics of the appliances and not tooth movement directly. Invisalign (Inv) had a higher mean value than the other types of materials that were analyzed, which suggested a potentially greater impact on orthodontic tooth movement. However, its variance value indicated that there was also greater uncertainty associated with the estimate compared to some of the other plastics. These findings could have important implications for orthodontic treatment planning and aligner material selection.

AB  - Background: In the realm of orthodontics, the evaluation of treatment outcomes is a pivotal aspect. In recent times, artificial intelligence (AI) models have garnered attention as potential tools for predicting these outcomes. These AI models have the potential to enhance treatment planning and decision-making processes. However, a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness and accuracy is essential before their widespread integration. Materials and Methods: In this study, we assessed the capability of AI models to predict treatment outcomes in orthodontics. A sample of 30 patients undergoing orthodontic treatment was selected. Various patient-specific parameters, including age, initial malocclusion severity, and treatment approach, were collected. The AI model was trained using a dataset comprising historical treatment cases and their respective outcomes. Subsequently, the trained AI model was applied to predict the treatment outcomes for the selected patients. Results: The results of this study indicated a moderate level of accuracy in the predictions made by the AI model. Out of the 30 patients, the model accurately predicted treatment outcomes for 22 patients, yielding a success rate of approximately 73%. However, the model exhibited limitations in accurately predicting outcomes for cases involving complex malocclusions or those requiring non-standard treatment approaches. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of AI models in predicting treatment outcomes in orthodontics. While the AI model demonstrated promising accuracy in the majority of cases, its efficacy was diminished in complex and non-standard cases. Therefore, while AI models can serve as valuable tools to aid orthodontists in treatment planning, they should be utilized in conjunction with clinical expertise to ensure optimal decision-making and patient care. © 2024 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences.

AB  - In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has become more and more widespread in medicine and dentistry. It may contribute to improved quality of health care as diagnostic methods are getting more accurate and diagnostic errors are rarer in daily medical practice. The aim of this paper was to present data from the literature on the effectiveness of AI in orthodontic diagnostics based on the analysis of lateral cephalometric radiographs. A review of the literature from 2009 to 2023 has been performed using PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source databases. The accuracy of determining cephalometric landmarks using widely available commercial AI-based software and advanced AI algorithms was presented and discussed. Most AI algorithms used for the automated positioning of landmarks on cephalometric radiographs had relatively high accuracy. At the same time, the effectiveness of using AI in cephalometry varies depending on the algorithm or the application type, which has to be accounted for during the interpretation of the results. In conclusion, artificial intelligence is a promising tool that facilitates the identification of cephalometric landmarks in everyday clinical practice, may support orthodontic treatment planning for less experienced clinicians and shorten radiological examination in orthodontics. In the future, AI algorithms used for the automated localisation of cephalometric landmarks may be more accurate than manual analysis. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of oral surgery-related tissues from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images can significantly accelerate treatment planning and improve surgical accuracy. In this paper, we propose a fully automated tissue segmentation system for dental implant surgery. Specifically, we propose an image preprocessing method based on data distribution histograms, which can adaptively process CBCT images with different parameters. Based on this, we use the bone segmentation network to obtain the segmentation results of alveolar bone, teeth, and maxillary sinus. We use the tooth and mandibular regions as the ROI regions of tooth segmentation and mandibular nerve tube segmentation to achieve the corresponding tasks. The tooth segmentation results can obtain the order information of the dentition. The corresponding experimental results show that our method can achieve higher segmentation accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Its average Dice scores on the tooth, alveolar bone, maxillary sinus, and mandibular canal segmentation tasks were 96.5%, 95.4%, 93.6%, and 94.8%, respectively. These results demonstrate that it can accelerate the development of digital dentistry. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The first stage of digestion starts from the mouth. If the teeth are not in good health, they may affect the person’s eating and cause a disturbance in the digestive system. In addition, damaged teeth cause a person’s self-confidence to decline while laughing and talking. Therefore, diagnosing and treating damaged teeth is of great importance in dentistry. Deep learning has been able to speed up and improve human performance in identifying many dental diseases, diagnosing oral cancer, and diagnosing the treatment stage. In medicine, deep learning applications face challenges due to the need for labeled datasets, and the field of dentistry is no exception. This pilot study used 1025 dental x-ray panoramic images of patients over 14 for dental treatment planning. A dentist with more than 25 years of experience assisted us in conducting this research. The dentist consulted with other dentists in his team to increase the reliability of the treatment plans presented for each panoramic image and then labeled the images. After labeling these images, YOLOv7, which belongs to the family of the You Only Look Once (YOLO), a convolutional neural network model, is used to process the images due to its advantages, especially performing quickly with high accuracy on small datasets. The proposed model identifies damaged teeth by drawing bounding boxes around them, then indicates the proper treatment plan for each damaged tooth state. The released treatment plan concludes an overall of 8 distinct treatments which can be applied in multiple stages to cure the teeth. After training the model, it was tested on the test set, a portion of the dataset that was not used to train the model, to evaluate its performance. The model achieves a precision of 100%, F1 score of 76%, Recall of 96%, and mAP of 81.9%, indicating that this model has excellent potential for clinical use by dentists. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Background: Most radiotherapy structures contoured on CT scans during IMRT planning are defined by the ICRU, forming part of standard practice. Associated dose-volume constraints serve as parameters for dose computation algorithms to produce optimized dose maps. On the ground, however, physicists/dosimetrists routinely delineate auxiliary “non-standard” radiotherapy structures (nsRS). Materials/Methods: From 287 patients’ data, five categories of nsRS were identified. Inter-center, inter-patient variability, and temporal trends in nsRS use were investigated. Relation of nsRS with topological complexity, plan quality, calculated quality assurance (QA) and expert QA, was investigated using machine learning classification. Results: nsRS accounted for 19.2% of all structures. Average number of nsRS per patient was 8.92 ± 6.70. Variation coefficient across centers was > 70% for nsRS frequency. There was no effect of patient volume per center on averaged nsRS number between low, intermediate, and high-volume centers. No temporal trends in nsRS use were detected at the high-volume centers, except for an increase in ‘forced-dose’ nsRS (p = 3.08 × (10)^(−5)) at one center. Machine learning prediction accuracy including nsRS features were 0.70 ± 0.06 for topological complexity, 0.58 ± 0.05 for calculated QA and 0.72 ± 0.05 for expert QA. Conclusion: Use of nsRS is frequent but heterogeneous and should be standardized further in line with ICRU initiatives in IMRT planning. Use of nsRS should be documented with respect to the need for nsRS from dose computation algorithms of treatment planning systems and IMRT machines in terms of modulation capacity and plan robustness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - —In the field of orthodontics, the accurate identification of cephalometric landmarks in dental radiography plays a crucial role in ensuring precise diagnoses and efficient treatment planning. Previous studies have demonstrated the impressive capabilities of advanced deep learning models in this particular domain. However, due to the ever-changing technological landscape, it is imperative to consistently investigate and explore emerging algorithms to further improve efficiency in this field. The present study centers around the assessment of the effectiveness of YOLOv8, the most recent version of the’You Only Look Once (YOLO)’ algorithm series, with a particular emphasis on its autonomous capability to accurately identify cephalometric landmarks. In this study, a thorough examination was conducted to evaluate the YOLOv8 algorithm efficiency in detecting cephalometric landmarks. The assessments encompassed various aspects such as precision, adaptability in challenging conditions, and a comparative analysis with alternative algorithms. The predefined proximities of 2mm, 2.5mm, and 3mm were utilized for the comparisons. By focusing on its potential as a noteworthy breakthrough, the investigation seeks to ascertain whether the recent enhancements indeed bring about a significant stride in the precise identification of cephalometric landmarks. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Background: Dental age is crucial for treatment planning in pediatric and orthodontic dentistry. Dental age calculation methods can be categorized into morphological, biochemical, and radiological methods. Radiological methods are commonly used because they are non-invasive and reproducible. When radiographs are available, dental age can be calculated by evaluating the developmental stage of permanent teeth and converting it into an estimated age using a table, or by measuring the length between some landmarks such as the tooth, root, or pulp, and substituting them into regression formulas. However, these methods heavily depend on manual time-consuming processes. In this study, we proposed a novel and completely automatic dental age calculation method using panoramic radiographs and deep learning techniques. Methods: Overall, 8,023 panoramic radiographs were used as training data for Scaled-YOLOv4 to detect dental germs and mean average precision were evaluated. In total, 18,485 single-root and 16,313 multi-root dental germ images were used as training data for EfficientNetV2 M to classify the developmental stages of detected dental germs and Top-3 accuracy was evaluated since the adjacent stages of the dental germ looks similar and the many variations of the morphological structure can be observed between developmental stages. Scaled-YOLOv4 and EfficientNetV2 M were trained using cross-validation. We evaluated a single selection, a weighted average, and an expected value to convert the probability of developmental stage classification to dental age. One hundred and fifty-seven panoramic radiographs were used to compare automatic and manual human experts’ dental age calculations. Results: Dental germ detection was achieved with a mean average precision of 98.26% and dental germ classifiers for single and multi-root were achieved with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.46% and 98.36%, respectively. The mean absolute errors between the automatic and manual dental age calculations using single selection, weighted average, and expected value were 0.274, 0.261, and 0.396, respectively. The weighted average was better than the other methods and was accurate by less than one developmental stage error. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of automatic dental age calculation using panoramic radiographs and a two-stage deep learning approach with a clinically acceptable level of accuracy. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental panoramic imaging plays a pivotal role in dentistry for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, correctly positioning patients can be challenging for technicians due to the complexity of the imaging equipment and variations in patient anatomy, leading to positioning errors. These errors can compromise image quality and potentially result in misdiagnoses. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of accurately and efficiently identifying multiple positioning errors in dental panoramic imaging. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study used 552 panoramic images selected from a hospital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). We defined six types of errors (E1-E6) namely, (1) slumped position, (2) chin tipped low, (3) open lip, (4) head turned to one side, (5) head tilted to one side, and (6) tongue against the palate. First, six Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were employed to extract image features, which were then fused using transfer learning. Next, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to create a classifier for multiple positioning errors, using the fused image features. Finally, the classifier performance was evaluated using 3 indices of precision, recall rate, and accuracy. RESULTS: Experimental results show that the fusion of image features with six binary SVM classifiers yielded high accuracy, recall rates, and precision. Specifically, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.832 for identifying multiple positioning errors. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that six SVM classifiers effectively identify multiple positioning errors in dental panoramic imaging. The fusion of extracted image features and the employment of SVM classifiers improve diagnostic precision, suggesting potential enhancements in dental imaging efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Future research should consider larger datasets and explore real-time clinical application. © 2023 – IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is the most common craniofacial malformation, with a range of physical, psychological, and aesthetic consequences. In this comprehensive review, our main objective is to thoroughly examine the relationship between CLP anomalies and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in children. Additionally, we aim to explore how the integration of AI technology can bring about significant advancements in the fields of diagnosis, treatment methods, and predictive outcomes. By analyzing the existing evidence, we will highlight state-of-the-art algorithms and predictive AI models that play a crucial role in achieving precise diagnosis, susceptibility assessment, and treatment planning for children with CLP anomalies. Our focus will specifically be on the efficacy of alveolar bone graft and orthodontic interventions. The findings of this review showed that deep learning (DL) models revolutionize the diagnostic process, predict susceptibility to CLP, and enhance alveolar bone grafts and orthodontic treatment. DL models surpass human capabilities in terms of precision, and AI algorithms applied to large datasets can uncover the intricate genetic and environmental factors contributing to CLP. Additionally, Machine learning aids in preoperative planning for alveolar bone grafts and provides personalized treatment plans in orthodontic treatment. In conclusion, these advancements inspire optimism for a future where AI seamlessly integrates with CLP management, augmenting its analytical capabilities. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Introduction: Periodontitis is the main cause of tooth loss and is related to many systemic diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) in periodontics has the potential to improve the accuracy of risk assessment and provide personalized treatment planning for patients with periodontitis. This systematic review aims to examine the actual evidence on the accuracy of various AI models in predicting periodontitis. Methods: Using a mix of MeSH keywords and free text words pooled by Boolean operators (‘AND’, ‘OR’), a search strategy without a time frame setting was conducted on the following databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Explore. The QUADAS-2 risk of bias assessment was then performed. Results: From a total of 961 identified records screened, 8 articles were included for qualitative analysis: 4 studies showed an overall low risk of bias, 2 studies an unclear risk, and the remaining 2 studies a high risk. The most employed algorithms for periodontitis prediction were artificial neural networks, followed by support vector machines, decision trees, logistic regression, and random forest. The models showed good predictive performance for periodontitis according to different evaluation metrics, but the presented methods were heterogeneous. Conclusions: AI algorithms may improve in the future the accuracy and reliability of periodontitis prediction. However, to date, most of the studies had a retrospective design and did not consider the most modern deep learning networks. Although the available evidence is limited by a lack of standardized data collection and protocols, the potential benefits of using AI in periodontics are significant and warrant further research and development in this area. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The use of AI in periodontics can lead to more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as improved patient education and engagement. Despite the current challenges and limitations of the available evidence, particularly the lack of standardized data collection and analysis protocols, the potential benefits of using AI in periodontics are significant and warrant further research and development in this area. © International Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research and American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 2024.

AB  - High-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) models of tooth-bone structures are valuable for virtual dental treatment planning; however, they require integrating data from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral scans (IOS) using methods that are either error-prone or time-consuming. Hence, this study presents Deep Dental Multimodal Fusion (DDMF), an automatic multimodal framework that reconstructs 3D tooth-bone structures using CBCT and IOS. Specifically, the DDMF framework comprises CBCT and IOS segmentation modules as well as a multimodal reconstruction module with novel pixel representation learning architectures, prior knowledge-guided losses, and geometry-based 3D fusion techniques. Experiments on real-world large-scale datasets revealed that DDMF achieved superior segmentation performance on CBCT and IOS, achieving a 0.17 mm average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) for 3D fusion with a substantial processing time reduction. Additionally, clinical applicability studies have demonstrated DDMF's potential for accurately simulating tooth-bone structures throughout the orthodontic treatment process. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Tooth segmentation and classification from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a prerequisite for diagnosis and treatment planning in the majority of digital dental workflows. However, an accurate and efficient segmentation of teeth in the presence of metal artefacts still remains a challenge. Therefore, the following study aimed to validate an automated deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based tool for the segmentation and classification of teeth with orthodontic brackets on CBCT images. Methods: A total of 215 CBCT scans (1780 teeth) were retrospectively collected, consisting of pre-and post-operative images of the patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment. All the scans were acquired with NewTom CBCT device. A complete dentition with orthodontic brackets and high-quality images were included. The dataset were randomly divided into three subsets with random allocation of all 32 tooth classes: Training set (140 CBCT scans-400 teeth), validation set (35 CBCT scans-100 teeth), and test set (pre-operative: 25, post-operative: 15 = 40 CBCT scans-1280 teeth). A multiclass CNN-based tool was developed and its performance was assessed for automated segmentation and classification of teeth with brackets by comparison with a ground truth. Results: The CNN model took 13.7 ± 1.2 s for the segmentation and classification of all the teeth on a single CBCT image. Overall, the segmentation performance was excellent with a high intersection over union (IoU) of 0.99. Anterior teeth showed a significantly lower IoU (P < 0.05) compared to premolar and molar teeth. The dice similarity coefficient score of anterior (0.99 ± 0.02) and premolar teeth (0.99 ± 0.10) in the pre-operative group was comparable to the post-operative group. The classification of teeth to the correct 32 classes had a high recall rate (99.9%) and precision (99%). Conclusions: The proposed CNN model outperformed other state-of-The-Art algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. It could act as a viable alternative for automatic segmentation and classification of teeth with brackets. Clinical Significance: The proposed method could simplify the existing digital workflows of orthodontics, orthognathic surgery, restorative dentistry, and dental implantology by offering an accurate and efficient automated segmentation approach to clinicians, hence further enhancing the treatment predictability and outcomes.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: This retrospective study aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm for the interpretation of panoramic radiographs and to examine the performance of this algorithm in the detection of periodontal bone losses and bone loss patterns. Methods: A total of 1121 panoramic radiographs were used in this study. Bone losses in the maxilla and mandibula (total alveolar bone loss) (n = 2251), interdental bone losses (n = 25303), and furcation defects (n = 2815) were labeled using the segmentation method. In addition, interdental bone losses were divided into horizontal (n = 21839) and vertical (n = 3464) bone losses according to the defect patterns. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based artificial intelligence (AI) system was developed using U-Net architecture. The performance of the deep learning algorithm was statistically evaluated by the confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis. Results: The system showed the highest diagnostic performance in the detection of total alveolar bone losses (AUC = 0.951) and the lowest in the detection of vertical bone losses (AUC = 0.733). The sensitivity, precision, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC values were found as 1, 0.995, 0.997, 0.994, 0.951 for total alveolar bone loss; found as 0.947, 0.939, 0.943, 0.892, 0.910 for horizontal bone losses; found as 0.558, 0.846, 0.673, 0.506, 0.733 for vertical bone losses and found as 0.892, 0.933, 0.912, 0.837, 0.868 for furcation defects (respectively). Conclusions: AI systems offer promising results in determining periodontal bone loss patterns and furcation defects from dental radiographs. This suggests that CNN algorithms can also be used to provide more detailed information such as automatic determination of periodontal disease severity and treatment planning in various dental radiographs. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose of Review: This review was conducted to focus on how artificial intelligence (AI) could be applied to provide great development in aesthetic dentistry. The historical development, advantages and disadvantages, classification, types, present and advanced dental applications, and their potential perspectives are summarized and explained. Recent Findings: Most of the AI applications in dentistry revolve around diagnosis (radiographic or optical images), decision-making improvement, suggestion of treatment plans, and prediction of treatment progress. Various recent innovative AI tools could be employed for the improvement of professional practice and patient outcomes. Dental applications of AI can be divided into four categories: diagnostics, decision-making, treatment planning, and treatment result prediction. Advanced dental applications include the creation of perfect digital smile designs, AI-based 3D printing, assessment of endodontic complexity, AI-based FEA, AI-based CAD/CAM, AI dental phonetic apps, and eye-tracking dental applications. Summary: AI has significantly transformed aesthetic dentistry in recent years. It is developing quickly, with potential uses in many different aspects like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment prediction. Although AI is a relatively young technology, it is widely used in dentistry. AI applications in dentistry include nearly all dental disciplines, such as dental radiology, dental caries diagnosis, orthodontics, implant dentistry, fixed prosthetic restorations, and endodontics. The knowledge of the dental professional must be updated regarding the application of AI in the dental field. Hence, the objective of this review was to represent the literature relevant to the applications of AI in the context of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and predicting successful treatment in aesthetic dentistry and, additionally, to identify the advanced and potential applications of AI. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Recently, deep learning (DL) has become increasingly important in the field of image processing, and its application in dental radiology has become particularly relevant. DL-based image recognition has become a key component of image interpretation in dental radiology, making it possible to automate diagnosis and treatment planning. These techniques can be applied to areas such as caries, tooth detection, periodontal disease, oral lesions, age determination, gender estimation, and osteoporosis. In addition, recent studies have shown that DL algorithms in these areas have high accuracy, with some studies achieving accuracy rates of over 90%. Such high accuracy can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of dental diagnostics and treatment planning. Thus, using DL in dental imaging may become an everyday tool in dentistry with the current advances in applications. In this paper, recent applications and potential challenges of using deep convolutional neural network architectures in dental image analysis will be reviewed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - As the popularity of dental implants continues to grow at a rate of about 14% per year, so do the risks associated with the procedure. Complications such as sinusitis and nerve damage are not uncommon, and inadequate cleaning can lead to peri-implantitis around the implant, jeopardizing its stability and potentially necessitating retreatment. To address this issue, this research proposes a new system for evaluating the degree of periodontal damage around implants using Periapical film (PA). The system utilizes two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to accurately detect the location of the implant and assess the extent of damage caused by peri-implantitis. One of the CNN models is designed to determine the location of the implant in the PA with an accuracy of up to 89.31%, while the other model is responsible for assessing the degree of Peri-implantitis damage around the implant, achieving an accuracy of 90.45%. The system combines image cropping based on position information obtained from the first CNN with image enhancement techniques such as Histogram Equalization and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) to improve the visibility of the implant and gums. The result is a more accurate assessment of whether peri-implantitis has eroded to the first thread, a critical indicator of implant stability. To ensure the ethical and regulatory standards of our research, this proposal has been certified by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) under number 202102023B0C503. With no existing technology to evaluate Peri-implantitis damage around dental implants, this CNN-based system has the potential to revolutionize implant dentistry and improve patient outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Dental caries detection holds the key to unlocking brighter smiles and healthier lives by identifying one of the most common oral health issues early on. This vital topic sheds light on innovative ways to combat tooth decay, empowering individuals to take control of their oral health and maintain radiant smiles. This research paper delves into the realm of transfer learning techniques, aiming to elevate the precision and efficacy of dental caries diagnosis. Utilizing Keras ImageDataGenerator, a rich and balanced dataset is crafted by augmenting teeth images from the Kaggle teeth dataset. Five cutting-edge pre-trained architectures are harnessed in the transfer learning approach: EfficientNetV2B3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and ResNet50, with each model, initialized using ImageNet weights and tailored top layers. A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and false negative rates are employed to gauge the performance of these architectures. The findings unveil the unique advantages and drawbacks of each model, illuminating the path to an optimal choice for dental caries detection using Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). The testing accuracies achieved by EfficientNetV2B3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and ResNet50 models stand at 95.89%, 96.58%, 93.15%, 93.15%, and 94.18%, respectively. The Training accuracies stood at 100%, 99.91%, 100%, 100% and 100%, meanwhile on validation we achieved 97.63%, 96.68%, 98.82%, 96.68%, and 100% accuracies for EfficientNetV2B3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and ResNet50 models respectively. Capitalizing on transfer learning and juxtaposing diverse pre-trained architectures, this research paper paves the way for substantial advancements in dental diagnostic capabilities, culminating in enhanced patient outcomes and superior oral health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Skeletal Class III malocclusion is one type of dentofacial deformity that significantly affects patients’ facial aesthetics and oral health. The orthodontic treatment of skeletal Class III malocclusion presents challenges due to uncertainties surrounding mandibular growth patterns and treatment outcomes. In recent years, disease-specific radiographic features have garnered interest from researchers in various fields including orthodontics, for their exceptional performance in enhancing diagnostic precision and treatment effect predictability. The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the valuable radiographic features in the diagnosis and management of skeletal Class III malocclusion. Based on the existing literature, a series of analyses on lateral cephalograms have been concluded to identify the significant variables related to facial type classification, growth prediction, and decision-making for tooth extractions and orthognathic surgery in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion. Furthermore, we summarize the parameters regarding the inter-maxillary relationship, as well as different anatomical structures including the maxilla, mandible, craniofacial base, and soft tissues from conventional and machine learning statistical models. Several distinct radiographic features for Class III malocclusion have also been preliminarily observed using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Management of Class III (Cl III) dentoskeletal phenotype is often expert-driven. Purpose: The aim is to identify critical morphological features in postcircumpubertal Cl III treatment and appraise the predictive ability of innovative machine learning (ML) algorithms for adult Cl III malocclusion treatment planning. Study Design: The Orthodontics Department at the University of Illinois Chicago undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study analyzing Cl III malocclusion cases (2003-2020) through dental records and pretreatment lateral cephalograms. Predictor: Forty features were identified through a literature review and gathered from pretreatment records, serving as ML model inputs. Eight ML models were trained to predict the best treatment for adult Cl III malocclusion. Outcome variable: Predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models, along with the highest-contributing features, were evaluated for performance assessment. Covariates: Demographic covariates, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were assessed. Inclusion criteria targeted patients with cervical vertebral maturation stage 4 or above. Operative covariates such as tooth extraction and types of orthognathic surgical maneuvers were also analyzed. Analyses: Demographic characteristics of the camouflage and surgical study groups were described statistically. Shapiro-Wilk Normality test was employed to check data distribution. Differences in means between groups were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric independent sample tests, with statistical significance set at <0.05. Results: The study involved 182 participants; 65 underwent camouflage mechanotherapy, and 117 received orthognathic surgery. No statistical differences were found in demographic characteristics between the two groups (P >.05). Extreme values of pretreatment parameters suggested a surgical approach. Artificial neural network algorithms predicted treatment approach with 91% accuracy, while the Extreme Gradient Boosting model achieved 93% accuracy after recursive feature elimination optimization. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model highlighted Wit's appraisal, anterior overjet, and Mx/Md ratio as key predictors. Conclusions: The research identified significant cephalometric differences between Cl III adults requiring orthodontic camouflage or surgery. A 93% accurate artificial intelligence model was formulated based on these insights, highlighting the potential role of artificial intelligence and ML as adjunct tools in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. This may assist in minimizing clinician subjectivity in borderline cases. © 2023 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Featured Application: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are capable of learning complex patterns and features from images. An automatic teeth segmentation CNN model can accurately and efficiently identify the boundaries and contours of individual teeth in dental radiographs or 3D dental scans. This can save significant time and effort compared to manual segmentation by dental professionals. Precise segmentation of teeth can assist in the diagnosis and treatment planning process. By accurately identifying the boundaries of teeth, dental practitioners can more effectively analyze dental conditions, such as tooth decay, gum diseases, or orthodontic abnormalities. This enables them to make informed decisions regarding appropriate treatment options and personalized treatment plans. Background and purpose: Accurate instance segmentation of teeth in panoramic dental X-rays is a challenging task due to variations in tooth morphology and overlapping regions. In this study, we propose a new algorithm, for instance, segmentation of the different teeth in panoramic dental X-rays. Methods: An instance segmentation model was trained using the architecture of a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN). The data for the training, validation, and testing were taken from the Tuft dental database (1000 panoramic dental radiographs). The number of the predicted label was 52 (20 deciduous and 32 permanent). The size of the training, validation, and test sets were 760, 190, and 70 images, respectively, and the split was performed randomly. The model was trained for 300 epochs, using a batch size of 10, a base learning rate of 0.001, and a warm-up multistep learning rate scheduler (gamma = 0.1). Data augmentation was performed by changing the brightness, contrast, crop, and image size. The percentage of correctly detected teeth and Dice in the test set were used as the quality metrics for the model. Results: In the test set, the percentage of correctly classified teeth was 98.4%, while the Dice score was 0.87. For both the left mandibular central and lateral incisor permanent teeth, the Dice index result was 0.91 and the accuracy was 100%. For the permanent teeth right mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and third molar, the Dice indexes were 0.92, 0.93, and 0.78, respectively, with an accuracy of 100% for all three different teeth. For deciduous teeth, the Dice indexes for the right mandibular lateral incisor, right mandibular canine, and right mandibular first molar were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.85, respectively, with an accuracy of 100%. Conclusions: A successful instance segmentation model for teeth identification in panoramic dental X-ray was developed and validated. This model may help speed up and automate tasks like teeth counting and identifying specific missing teeth, improving the current clinical practice. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Intra-oral scans and gypsum cast scans (OS) are widely used in orthodontics, prosthetics, implantology, and orthognathic surgery to plan patient-specific treatments, which require teeth segmentations with high accuracy and resolution. Manual teeth segmentation, the gold standard up until now, is time-consuming, tedious, and observer-dependent. This study aims to develop an automated teeth segmentation and labeling system using deep learning. Material and methods: As a reference, 1750 OS were manually segmented and labeled. A deep-learning approach based on PointCNN and 3D U-net in combination with a rule-based heuristic algorithm and a combinatorial search algorithm was trained and validated on 1400 OS. Subsequently, the trained algorithm was applied to a test set consisting of 350 OS. The intersection over union (IoU), as a measure of accuracy, was calculated to quantify the degree of similarity between the annotated ground truth and the model predictions. Results: The model achieved accurate teeth segmentations with a mean IoU score of 0.915. The FDI labels of the teeth were predicted with a mean accuracy of 0.894. The optical inspection showed excellent position agreements between the automatically and manually segmented teeth components. Minor flaws were mostly seen at the edges. Conclusion: The proposed method forms a promising foundation for time-effective and observer-independent teeth segmentation and labeling on intra-oral scans. Clinical significance: Deep learning may assist clinicians in virtual treatment planning in orthodontics, prosthetics, implantology, and orthognathic surgery. The impact of using such models in clinical practice should be explored. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hyperdontia can cause numerous aesthetic and functional problems. The diagnosis is made radiologically, and the most commonly used radiological method is orthopantomography, while CBCT is also used. CBCT has the advantage of being three-dimensional. Artificial Intelligence is widely used in medicine and dentistry, and it can create a specific algorithm to aid in diagnosis and suggest therapeutic procedures. In a case report, a 6-year-old boy was diagnosed with a supernumerary tooth between the upper central incisors. Orthopantomography revealed another impacted supernumerary tooth, and the patient was referred for CBCT. A platform for analyzing dental images, based on artificial intelligence, Diagnocat (Diagnocat Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA), was used for analysis and the AI system identified the supernumerary teeth and provided a complete plan for treatment. The use of AI in dentistry allows for faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Determining the severity of dental crowding and the necessity of tooth extraction for orthodontic treatment planning are time-consuming processes and there are no firm criteria. Thus, automated assistance would be useful to clinicians. This study aimed to construct and evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist with such treatment planning. A total of 3,136 orthodontic occlusal photographs with annotations by two orthodontists were obtained. Four convolutional neural network (CNN) models, namely ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19, were adopted for the AI process. Using the intraoral photographs as input, the crowding group and the necessity of tooth extraction were obtained. Arch length discrepancy analysis with AI-detected landmarks was used for crowding categorization. Various statistical and visual analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance. The maxillary and mandibular VGG19 models showed minimum mean errors of 0.84 mm and 1.06 mm for teeth landmark detection, respectively. Analysis of Cohen’s weighted kappa coefficient indicated that crowding categorization performance was best in VGG19 (0.73), decreasing in the order of VGG16, ResNet101, and ResNet50. For tooth extraction, the maxillary VGG19 model showed the highest accuracy (0.922) and AUC (0.961). By utilizing deep learning with orthodontic photographs, dental crowding categorization and diagnosis of orthodontic extraction were successfully determined. This suggests that AI can assist clinicians in the diagnosis and decision making of treatment plans. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Orthodontic treatment planning involves the precise assessment of dental and skeletal anomalies, which can be facilitated by AI‑enhanced diagnostic tools. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 orthodontic cases were included in this RCT. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: an AI‑enhanced diagnostic group and a traditional diagnostic group. The AI‑enhanced diagnostic group underwent orthodontic assessment with the aid of AI‑powered software, which provided automated cephalometric analysis, 3D model evaluations, and treatment suggestions. The traditional diagnostic group received conventional diagnostic assessments by orthodontists. The primary outcome measures included treatment planning accuracy, treatment time, and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included the number of appointments required and treatment cost. Results: The AI‑enhanced diagnostic group demonstrated a significantly higher accuracy in treatment planning compared to the traditional diagnostic group (P < 0.05). The AI group also required fewer appointments (mean ± SD: 10.2 ± 2.1 vs. 12.8 ± 3.4) and had a shorter treatment time (mean ± SD: 14.6 ± 3.2 months vs. 18.9 ± 4.5 months) (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Additionally, patient satisfaction scores were higher in the AI group (mean ± SD: 9.2 ± 0.6 vs. 8.1 ± 0.8) (P < 0.001). However, the AI‑enhanced diagnostic group had a slightly higher treatment cost. Conclusion: AI‑enhanced diagnostic tools significantly enhance the accuracy of treatment planning in orthodontic cases, leading to reduced treatment time, fewer appointments, and increased patient satisfaction. © 2024 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Background: Designing appropriate clinical dental treatment plans is an urgent need because a growing number of dental patients are suffering from partial edentulism with the population getting older. Objectives: The aim of this study is to predict sequential treatment plans from electronic dental records. Methods: We construct a clinical decision support model, MultiTP, explores the unique topology of teeth information and the variation of complicated treatments, integrates deep learning models (convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network) adaptively, and embeds the attention mechanism to produce optimal treatment plans. Results: MultiTP shows its promising performance with an AUC of 0.9079 and an F score of 0.8472 over five treatment plans. The interpretability analysis also indicates its capability in mining clinical knowledge from the textual data. Conclusions: MultiTP's novel problem formulation, neural network framework, and interpretability analysis techniques allow for broad applications of deep learning in dental healthcare, providing valuable support for predicting dental treatment plans in the clinic and benefiting dental patients. Clinical implications: The MultiTP is an efficient tool that can be implemented in clinical practice and integrated into the existing EDR system. By predicting treatment plans for partial edentulism, the model will help dentists improve their clinical decisions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background/purpose: Vertical root fracture (VRF) is a prevalent reason for tooth extraction following root canal treatment and even after crown placement. Predicting fractures is challenging due to multifactorial nature. The current study aimed to predict the likelihood of fracture following root canal treatment and crown placement by developing a deep learning (DL) model. Materials and methods: DL techniques were employed to analyze a dataset comprising 145 clinical cases consisting of 97 fractured teeth and 48 non-fractured teeth. This dataset spanned a five-year period and encompassed cases involving root canal therapy and crown installation. The analysis identified several root fracture-related parameters, which were incorporated into the DL system. The dataset consisted of 17 features presented in a mixed-type tabular format. Results: The deep neural network (DNN) model surpassed the support vector machine (SVM) model with a higher accuracy (80.7 % vs. 71.7 %) and F1-score value (0.857 vs. 0.817) for predicting root fracture. Furthermore, in determining root fracture occurrence, it was observed that 17 significant characteristics in the DNN model outperformed the 7 features by 11.7 % in accuracy and 10 % in F1-score. Conclusion: DL shows promise in predicting root fracture post root canal therapy and prosthesis, and it may have the potential to aid clinicians in assessing fracture risk and improving decision-making. © 2023 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dental imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of dental conditions, yet limitations regarding the quality and resolution of dental radiographs sometimes hinder precise analysis. Super-resolution with deep learning refers to a set of techniques used to enhance the resolution of images beyond their original size or quality using deep neural networks instead of traditional image interpolation methods which often result in blurred or pixelated images when attempting to increase resolution. Leveraging advancements in technology, this study aims to enhance the resolution of dental panoramic radiographs, thereby enabling more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning. METHODS: About 1714 panoramic radiographs from 3 different open datasets are used for training (n = 1364) and testing (n = 350). The state of the art 4 different models is explored, namely Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network, Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, and Autoencoder. Performances in reconstructing high-resolution dental images from low-resolution inputs with different scales (s = 2, 4, 8) are evaluated by 2 well-accepted metrics Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). RESULTS: SSIM spans between 0.82 and 0.98 while PSNR are between 28.7 and 40.2 among all scales and models. SRCNN provides the best performance. Additionally, it is observed that performance decreased when images are scaled with higher values. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the potential of super-resolution concepts to significantly improve the quality and detail of dental panoramic radiographs, thereby contributing to enhanced interpretability. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study introduces a novel approach for the segmentation and classification of tooth types in 3D dental models, leveraging the Adaptive Enhanced GoogLeNet (AEG) classifier and a Custom Mask Convolutional Neural Network (CM-CNN). Motivated by the complexities and potential misinterpretations in manual or semi-automatic tooth segmentation, our method aims to automate and enhance the accuracy of dental image analysis. The 3D dental models are processed using CM-CNN for segmentation, followed by classification using the AEG classifier. The significance of this work lies in its potential to provide a reliable and efficient solution for precise tooth categorization, contributing to improved diagnostic procedures and treatment planning in dentistry. Comparative analyses demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure when compared to conventional techniques such as traditional geometrical transformation and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (TD-model) and deep CNN (DCNN). The outcomes suggest the method's practical applicability in real-world dental scenarios, offering a promising contribution to the ongoing integration of AI in dentistry. This study employs a dataset of 3D dental models, and its significance lies in addressing the challenges associated with tooth segmentation and classification in dental images. Dental X-ray pictures play a crucial role in predicting dental disorders, and precise tooth segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Manual or semi-automatic segmentation processes are prone to misinterpretations due to image noise and similarities between tooth types. The proposed method, integrating CM-CNN and AEG, aims to automate this process, providing accurate tooth categorization. The significance of achieving this automation is notable in enhancing the overall efficiency of dental image analysis, contributing to quicker and more accurate diagnoses. The outcomes of the study showcase the method's superiority over conventional techniques, indicating its potential impact on improving dental diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies, ultimately benefiting both dental practitioners and patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Objectives: Dental radiographs, particularly bitewing radiographs, are widely used in dental diagnosis and treatment Dental image segmentation is difficult for various reasons, such as intricate structures, low contrast, noise, roughness, and unclear borders, resulting in poor image quality. Recent developments in deep learning models have improved performance in analyzing dental images. In this research, our primary objective is to determine the most effective segmentation technique for bitewing radiographs based on different metrics: accuracy, training time, and the number of training parameters as a reflection of architectural cost. Methods: In this research, we employ several deep learning models, namely Resnet-18, Resnet-50, Xception, Inception Resnet v2, and Mobilenetv2, to segment bitewing radiographs. The process begins by importing the radiographs into MATLAB®(MathWorks Inc), where the images are first improved, then segmented using the graph cut method based on regions to produce a binary mask that distinguishes the background from the original X-ray. Results: The deep learning models were trained on 298 and 99 radiograph training and validation sets and were evaluated using 99 images from the testing set. We also compare the segmentation model using several criteria, including accuracy, speed, and size, to determine which network is superior. Furthermore, we compare our findings with prior research to provide a comprehensive understanding of the advancements made in dental image segmentation. The accurate segmentation achieved was 93.67% and 94.42% by the Resnet-18 and Resnet-50 models, respectively. Conclusion: This research advances dental image analysis and facilitates more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning by determining the best segmentation technique. The outcomes of this study can guide researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate segmentation methods for practical dental image analysis. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology 2023.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized in soft-tissue analysis and prediction in orthodontic treatment planning, although its reliability has not been systematically assessed. This scoping review was conducted to outline the development of AI in terms of predicting soft-tissue changes after orthodontic treatment, as well as to comprehensively evaluate its prediction accuracy. Six electronic databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) were searched up to March 14, 2023. Clinical studies investigating the performance of AI-based systems in predicting post-orthodontic soft-tissue alterations were included. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal checklist for diagnostic test accuracy studies were applied to assess risk of bias, while the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment was conducted to evaluate the certainty of outcomes. After screening 2500 studies, four non-randomized clinical trials were finally included for full-text evaluation. We found a low level of evidence indicating an estimated high overall accuracy of AI-generated prediction, whereas the lower lip and chin seemed to be the least predictable regions. Furthermore, the facial morphology simulated by AI via the fusion of multimodality images was considered to be reasonably true. Since all of the included studies that were not randomized clinical trials (non-RCTs) showed a moderate to high risk of bias, more well-designed clinical trials with sufficient sample size are needed in future work. © 2023, Zhejiang University Press.

AB  - Aim: To know attitudes, perceptions and barriers towards the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in dentistry in India among undergraduate and postgraduate students. Methodology: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted among participants pursuing graduation and postgraduation. The questionnaire consisted of 23 close-ended and 2 open-ended questions divided into various sections of attitude, perception and barriers. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. Result: Out of 937 responses, 55.2% responded that they get information about AI from social media platforms. 51.3% of respondents have basic knowledge about the use of AI in dentistry. 59.6% agreed that AI can be used as a “definitive diagnostic tool” in the diagnosis of diseases. 66.5% agreed that AI can be used for radiographic diagnosis of tooth caries. 71.3% stated that AI can be used as a “treatment planning tool” in dentistry. 55.7% stated that AI should be part of undergraduate dental training. Conclusion: This study concluded that both dental students are aware of the concept of AI. Participants were positive when asked if AI can increase the efficiency of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning procedures as well as in managing patient data. Both participants believed that the barriers to the introduction of AI in dentistry are a lack of technical resources and a lack of training personnel in college. © 2023

AB  - Objective: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive and intellectual human tasks. In dentistry, AI offers the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve patient outcomes and streamline workflows. The present study provides a framework and a checklist to evaluate AI applications in dentistry from this perspective. Methods: Lending from existing guidance documents, an initial draft of the checklist and an explanatory paper were derived and discussed among the groups members. Results: The checklist was consented to in an anonymous voting process by 29 Topic Group Dental Diagnostics and Digital Dentistry, ITU/WHO Focus Group AI on Health's members. Overall, 11 principles were identified (diversity, transparency, wellness, privacy protection, solidarity, equity, prudence, law and governance, sustainable development, accountability, and responsibility, respect of autonomy, decision-making). Conclusions: Providers, patients, researchers, industry, and other stakeholders should consider these principles when developing, implementing, or receiving AI applications in dentistry. Clinical Significance: While AI has become increasingly commonplace in dentistry, there are ethical concerns around its usage, and users (providers, patients, and other stakeholders), as well as the industry should consider these when developing, implementing, or receiving AI applications based on comprehensive framework to address the associated ethical challenges. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The characteristics of maxillofacial morphology play a major role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. While Sassouni’s classification scheme outlines different categories of maxillofacial morphology, there is no standardized approach to assigning these classifications to patients. This study aimed to create an artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses cephalometric analysis measurements to accurately classify maxillofacial morphology, allowing for the standardization of maxillofacial morphology classification. This study used the initial cephalograms of 220 patients aged 18 years or older. Three orthodontists classified the maxillofacial morphologies of 220 patients using eight measurements as the accurate classification. Using these eight cephalometric measurement points and the subject’s gender as input features, a random forest classifier from the Python sci-kit learning package was trained and tested with a k-fold split of five to determine orthodontic classification; distinct models were created for horizontal-only, vertical-only, and combined maxillofacial morphology classification. The accuracy of the combined facial classification was 0.823 ± 0.060; for anteroposterior-only classification, the accuracy was 0.986 ± 0.011; and for the vertical-only classification, the accuracy was 0.850 ± 0.037. ANB angle had the greatest feature importance at 0.3519. The AI model created in this study accurately classified maxillofacial morphology, but it can be further improved with more learning data input. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Third molar surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Considering the patient’s young age and the often-elective nature of the procedure, a comprehensive preoperative evaluation of the surgical site, relying heavily on preoperative imaging, is key to providing accurate diagnostic work-up, evidence-based clinical decision making, and, when appropriate, indication-specific surgical planning. Given the rapid developments of dental imaging in the field, the aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date clinical overview of various imaging techniques related to perioperative imaging in third molar surgery, ranging from panoramic radiography to emerging technologies, such as photon-counting computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Each modality’s advantages, limitations, and recent improvements are evaluated, highlighting their role in treatment planning, complication prevention, and postoperative follow-ups. The integration of recent technological advances, including artificial intelligence and machine learning in biomedical imaging, coupled with a thorough preoperative clinical evaluation, marks another step towards personalized dentistry in high-risk third molar surgery. This approach enables minimally invasive surgical approaches while reducing inefficiencies and risks by incorporating additional imaging modality- and patient-specific parameters, potentially facilitating and improving patient management. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Detecting the tooth-gingiva trim line from a dental surface plays a critical role in dental treatment planning and aligner 3D printing. Existing methods treat this task as a segmentation problem, which is resolved with geometric deep learning based mesh segmentation techniques. However, these methods can only provide indirect results (i.e., segmented teeth) and suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy due to the incapability of making full use of high-resolution dental surfaces. To this end, we propose a two-stage geometric deep learning framework for automatically detecting tooth-gingiva trim lines from dental surfaces. Our framework consists of a trim line proposal network (TLP-Net) for predicting an initial trim line from the low-resolution dental surface as well as a trim line refinement network (TLR-Net) for refining the initial trim line with the information from the high-resolution dental surface. Specifically, our TLP-Net predicts the initial trim line by fusing the multi-scale features from a U-Net with a proposed residual multi-scale attention fusion module. Moreover, we propose feature bridge modules and a trim line loss to further improve the accuracy. The resulting trim line is then fed to our TLR-Net, which is a deep-based LDDMM model with the high-resolution dental surface as input. In addition, dense connections are incorporated into TLR-Net for improved performance. Our framework provides an automatic solution to trim line detection by making full use of raw high-resolution dental surfaces. Extensive experiments on a clinical dental surface dataset demonstrate that our TLP-Net and TLR-Net are superior trim line detection methods and outperform cutting-edge methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at systematically evaluating dental practitioners’ clinical decision-making processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning method for dental panoramic image segmentation, which is crucial in oral medicine and orthodontics for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods often fail to effectively combine global and local context, and struggle with unlabeled data, limiting performance in varied clinical settings. We address these issues with an advanced TransUNet architecture, enhancing feature retention and utilization by connecting the input and output layers directly. Our architecture further employs spatial and channel attention mechanisms in the decoder segments for targeted region focus, and deep supervision techniques to overcome the vanishing gradient problem for more efficient training. Additionally, our network includes a self-learning algorithm using unlabeled data, boosting generalization capabilities. Named the Semi-supervised Tooth Segmentation Transformer U-Net (STS-TransUNet), our method demonstrated superior performance on the MICCAI STS-2D dataset, proving its effectiveness and robustness in tooth segmentation tasks. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Orthodontics is a field that has seen significant advancements in recent years, with technology playing a crucial role in improving diagnosis and treatment planning. The study aimed to implement artificial intelligence to predict the arch width as a preventive measure to avoid future crowding in growing patients or even in adult patients seeking orthodontic treatment as a tool for orthodontic diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and fifty intraoral scan (IOS) images were selected from orthodontic patients seeking treatment in private orthodontic centers. Real inter-canine, inter-premolar, and inter-molar widths were measured digitally. Two of the main machine learning models were used: the Python programming language and machine learning algorithms, implementing the data on k-nearest neighbor and linear regression. Results: After the dataset had been implemented on the two ML algorithms, linear regression and k-nearest neighbor, the evaluation metric shows that KNN gives better prediction accuracy than LR does. The resulting accuracy was around 99%. Conclusions: it is possible to leverage machine learning to enhance orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning by predicting linear dental arch measurements and preventing anterior segment malocclusion. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Accurate segmentation of individual tooth and their substructures including enamel, pulp, and dentin from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is essential for dental diagnosis and treatment planning in digital dentistry. Existing methods for tooth segmentation based on CBCT images have achieved substantial progress; however, techniques for further segmentation into substructures are yet to be developed. Purpose: We aim to propose a novel three-stage progressive deep-learning-based framework for automatically segmenting 3D tooth from CBCT images, focusing on finer substructures, i.e., enamel, pulp, and dentin. Methods: In this paper, we first detect each tooth using its centroid by a clustering scheme, which efficiently determines each tooth detection by applying learned displacement vectors from the foreground tooth region. Next, guided by the detected centroid, each tooth proposal, combined with the corresponding tooth map, is processed through our tooth segmentation network. We also present an attention-based hybrid feature fusion mechanism, which provides intricate details of the tooth boundary while maintaining the global tooth shape, thereby enhancing the segmentation process. Additionally, we utilize the skeleton of the tooth as a guide for subsequent substructure segmentation. Results: Our algorithm is extensively evaluated on a collected dataset of 314 patients, and the extensive comparison and ablation studies demonstrate superior segmentation results of our approach. Conclusions: Our proposed method can automatically segment tooth and finer substructures from CBCT images, underlining its potential applicability for clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The accuracy of cephalometric landmark identification for malocclusion classification is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. Identifying these landmarks is often complex and time-consuming for orthodontists. An AI model for classification was recently developed. This model was investigated based on current regulatory considerations as a result of the strict regulations on software systems and the lack of information on artificial intelligence (AI) requirements in this publication. The platform developed by the ITU/WHO for AI is used to assess the models of the application. The auditing procedure assessed the development process concerning medical device regulations, data protection regulations, and ethical considerations. Upon that, the major tasks during the development were evaluated, such as qualification, annotation procedure, and data set attributes. The AI models were investigated under consideration of technical, clinical, regulatory, and ethical considerations. The risk to the patient and user’s health can be considered low according to the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) definition. This application facilitates the decision and planning of malocclusion treatment based on lateral cephalograms without cephalometric landmarks. It is comparable with common standards in orthodontic diagnosis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In modern dentistry, teeth localization, segmentation, and labeling from intra-oral 3D scans are crucial for improving dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and population-based studies on oral health. However, creating automated algorithms for teeth analysis is a challenging task due to the limited availability of accessible data for training, particularly from the point of view of deep learning. This study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh masked autoencoder (MeshMAE) transformer. While the MeshMAE loss measures the quality of reconstructed masked mesh triangles, the loss of the proposed DentalMAE evaluates the predicted deep embeddings of masked mesh triangles. This yields a better generalization ability on a very limited number of 3D dental scans, as documented by our results on teeth segmentation of intra-oral scans. Our results show that masking-based unsupervised learning methods may, for the first time, provide convincing transfer learning improvements on 3D intra-oral scans, increasing the overall accuracy over both MeshMAE and prior self-supervised pre-training. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of deep learning algorithms to diagnose tooth caries and classify the extension and location of dental caries in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the application of deep learning for dental caries in CBCT images. Methods: The CBCT image dataset comprised 382 molar teeth with caries and 403 noncarious molar cases. The dataset was divided into a development set for training and validation and test set. Three images were obtained for each case, including axial, sagittal, and coronal. The test dataset was provided to a multiple-input convolutional neural network (CNN). The network made predictions regarding the presence or absence of dental decay and classified the lesions according to their depths and types for the provided samples. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score values were measured for dental caries detection and classification. Results: The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score for caries detection in carious molar teeth were 95.3%, 92.1%, 96.3%, and 93.2%, respectively, and for noncarious molar teeth were 94.8%, 94.3%, 95.8%, and 94.6%. The CNN network showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in classifying caries extensions and locations. Conclusions: This research demonstrates that deep learning models can accurately identify dental caries and classify their depths and types with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The successful application of deep learning in this field will undoubtedly assist dental practitioners and patients in improving diagnostic and treatment planning in dentistry. Clinical significance: : This study showed that deep learning can accurately detect and classify dental caries. Deep learning can provide dental caries detection accurately. Considering the shortage of dentists in certain areas, using CNNs can lead to broader geographic coverage in detecting dental caries. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The desire for an attractive smile is a major reason people seek orthodontic and other forms of cosmetic dental treatment. An understanding of the features of a smile is important for dental diagnosis and treatment planning. The common methods of smile analysis rely on the visual analysis of smile aesthetics using posed photographs, and videos and gathering information about smiles through patient questionnaires and diaries. Recent emerging trends utilise artificial intelligence and automated systems capable of detecting and analysing smiles using motion capture, computer vision, computer graphics, infrared and thermal imaging, electromyography, and optical sensors. This review aims to provide an up-to-date summary of emerging trends in smile analysis in dentistry and orthodontics. Understanding the advantages and limitations of emerging tools for smile analysis will enable clinicians to provide tailored and up-to-date treatment plans. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Dental CBCT and panoramic imaging play a pivotal role in dental diagnosis and treatment planning, alongside the indispensable use of computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging in dentistry, particularly for surgical planning. Given the widespread adoption of dental cone beam CT in clinics today, we explore a novel approach in this study—utilizing CT’s three-dimensional (3D) data to reconstruct a two-dimensional (2D) panoramic dental image. This method eliminates the requirement for an extra panoramic scan. In this work, we propose a novel framework to generate an enhanced and extended 2D panoramic view by using the dental arch extracted from 3D CBCT. Our method involves segmenting the patient’s dental arch from their 3D CBCT image by identifying horizontal slices with above-average intensity, followed by morphological operations, including dilation, Gaussian filtering, and skeletonization, to delineate the dental arch line. Additionally, we extend the dental arch beyond the wisdom teeth using quadratic curve fitting. Finally, we employ Maximum Intensity Projection on rotated cubic segments aligned with the dental arch curve to produce captivating panoramic images. The panoramic view produced using our proposed method, when compared to the results obtained from BlueSky and OpenInventor, exhibited superior enhancements and greater accuracy in panoramic visualization. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Two-dimensional cephalometric image analysis plays a crucial role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. While deep learning-based algorithms have emerged to automate the laborious task of anatomical landmark annotation, their effectiveness is hampered by the challenges of acquiring and labelling clinical data. In this study, we propose a model that leverages conventional machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of landmark detection using limited dataset. Materials and methods: Our methodology involves coarse localization through region of interest (ROI) extraction and fine localization utilizing histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) feature. The image patch containing landmark pixels is classified using the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm. To evaluate our model’s performance, we conducted rigorous tests on the ISBI Cephalometric dataset and Dental Cepha dataset, aiming to achieve accuracy within a 2 mm radial precision range. We also employed cross-validation to assess our approach, providing a robust evaluation. Results: Our model’s performance on the ISBI Cephalometric dataset showed an accuracy rate of 77.11% within the desired 2 mm radial precision range. The cross-validation results further confirmed the effectiveness of our approach, yielding a mean accuracy of 78.17%. Additionally, we applied our model to the Dental Cepha dataset, where we achieved a remarkable landmark detection accuracy of 84%. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that traditional machine learning techniques can be effective for accurate landmark detection in cephalometric images, even with limited data. Our findings highlight the potential of these techniques for clinical applications, where large datasets of labelled images may not be available. © 2023, The Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons of India.

AB  - Introduction Amid clinicians' challenges in staying updated with medical research, artificial intelligence (AI) tools like the large language model (LLM) ChatGPT could automate appraisal of research quality, saving time and reducing bias. This study compares the proficiency of ChatGPT3 against human evaluation in scoring abstracts to determine its potential as a tool for evidence synthesis. Methods We compared ChatGPT's scoring of implant dentistry abstracts with human evaluators using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for Abstracts reporting standards checklist, yielding an overall compliance score (OCS). Bland-Altman analysis assessed agreement between human and AI-generated OCS percentages. Additional error analysis included mean difference of OCS subscores, Welch's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of 4.92% (95% CI 0.62%, 0.37%) in OCS between human evaluation and ChatGPT. Error analysis displayed small mean differences in most domains, with the highest in € conclusion' (0.764 (95% CI 0.186, 0.280)) and the lowest in € blinding' (0.034 (95% CI 0.818, 0.895)). The strongest correlations between were in € harms' (r=0.32, p<0.001) and € trial registration' (r=0.34, p=0.002), whereas the weakest were in € intervention' (r=0.02, p<0.001) and € objective' (r=0.06, p<0.001). Conclusion LLMs like ChatGPT can help automate appraisal of medical literature, aiding in the identification of accurately reported research. Possible applications of ChatGPT include integration within medical databases for abstract evaluation. Current limitations include the token limit, restricting its usage to abstracts. As AI technology advances, future versions like GPT4 could offer more reliable, comprehensive evaluations, enhancing the identification of high-quality research and potentially improving patient outcomes. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - Objective: The three-dimensional morphological structures of periodontal ligaments (PDLs) are important data for periodontal, orthodontic, prosthodontic, and implant interventions. This study aimed to employ a deep learning (DL) algorithm to segment the PDL automatically in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Method: This was a retrospective study. We randomly selected 389 patients and 1734 axial CBCT images from the CBCT database, and designed a fully automatic PDL segmentation computer-aided model based on instance segmentation Mask R-CNN network. The labels of the model training were ‘teeth’ and ‘alveolar bone’, and the ‘PDL’ is defined as the region where the ‘teeth’ and ‘alveolar bone’ overlap. The model's segmentation performance was evaluated using CBCT data from eight patients outside the database. Results: Qualitative evaluation indicates that the PDL segmentation accuracy of incisors, canines, premolars, wisdom teeth, and implants reached 100%. The segmentation accuracy of molars was 96.4%. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the mIoU and mDSC of PDL segmentation were 0.667 ± 0.015 (>0.6) and 0.799 ± 0.015 (>0.7) respectively. Conclusion: This study analysed a unique approach to AI-driven automatic segmentation of PDLs on CBCT imaging, possibly enabling chair-side measurements of PDLs to facilitate periodontists, orthodontists, prosthodontists, and implantologists in more efficient and accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: The quantitative outcome of secondary reanimation after a failed primary reconstruction attempt for facial paralysis is rarely reported in the literature. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of secondary reanimation with gracilis free muscle transfer (GFMT) and whether this outcome is influenced by the primary reconstruction. Methods: Twelve patients with previously failed static procedures (static group, n = 6), temporal muscle transfer (temporal transfer group, n = 2), and GFMT (GFMT group, n = 4) were all secondarily reanimated with GFMT. The clinical outcome was graded with the eFACE metric. The objective oral commissure excursion was measured with Emotrics, and the artificial intelligence software FaceReader evaluated the intensity score (IS) of emotional expression. Results: The mean follow-up was 40 ± 27 months. The eFACE metric showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) postoperative improvement in the dynamic and smile scores across all groups. In the GFMT group, oral commissure with smile (75.75 ± 20.43 points), oral commissure excursion while smiling with teeth showing (32.7 ± 4.35 mm), and the intensity of happiness emotion while smiling without teeth showing (IS of 0.37 ± 0.23) were significantly lower as compared with the static group postoperatively (98.83 ± 2.86 points, p = 0.038; 41.7 ± 4.35 mm, p = 0.025; IS 0.83 ± 0.16, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our data suggest that secondary dynamic reconstruction with GFMT is feasible should the primary reconstruction fail. The secondary GFMT appears to improve the outcome of primary GFMT; however, the oral commissure excursion while smiling might be lower than that in patients who had static procedures as primary reconstruction. © 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons

AB  - In the field of orthodontics, providing patients with accurate treatment time estimates is of utmost importance. As orthodontic practices continue to evolve and embrace new advancements, incorporating machine learning (ML) methods becomes increasingly valuable in improving orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. This study aimed to develop a novel ML model capable of predicting the orthodontic treatment duration based on essential pre-treatment variables. Patients who completed comprehensive orthodontic treatment at the Indiana University School of Dentistry were included in this retrospective study. Fifty-seven pre-treatment variables were collected and used to train and test nine different ML models. The performance of each model was assessed using descriptive statistics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and one-way analysis of variance tests. Random Forest, Lasso, and Elastic Net were found to be the most accurate, with a mean absolute error of 7.27 months in predicting treatment duration. Extraction decision, COVID, intermaxillary relationship, lower incisor position, and additional appliances were identified as important predictors of treatment duration. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of ML in predicting orthodontic treatment duration using pre-treatment variables. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the automatic identification of the ridge deficiency around dental implants based on an image slice from cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT). Materials and methods: Single slices crossing the central long-axis of 630 mandibular and 845 maxillary virtually placed implants (4–5 mm diameter, 10 mm length) in 412 patients were used. The ridges were classified based on the intraoral bone-implant support and sinus floor location. The slices were either preprocessed by alveolar ridge homogenizing prior to DL (preprocessed) or left unpreprocessed. A convolutional neural network with ResNet-50 architecture was employed for DL. Results: The model achieved an accuracy of >98.5% on the unpreprocessed image slices and was found to be superior to the accuracy observed on the preprocessed slices. On the mandible, model accuracy was 98.91 ± 1.45%, and F1 score, a measure of a model's accuracy in binary classification tasks, was lowest (97.30%) on the ridge with a combined horizontal-vertical defect. On the maxilla, model accuracy was 98.82 ± 1.11%, and the ridge presenting an implant collar-sinus floor distance of 5–10 mm with a dehiscence defect had the lowest F1 score (95.86%). To achieve >90% model accuracy, ≥441 mandibular slices or ≥592 maxillary slices were required. Conclusions: The ridge deficiency around dental implants can be identified using DL from CBCT image slices without the need for preprocessed homogenization. The model will be further strengthened by implementing more clinical expertise in dental implant treatment planning and incorporating multiple slices to classify 3-dimensional implant-ridge relationships. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), technological progress is changing established workflows and enabling some basic routines to be updated. In dentistry, the patient’s face is a crucial part of treatment planning, although it has always been difficult to grasp in an analytical way. This review highlights the current digital advances that, thanks to AI tools, allow us to implement facial features beyond symmetry and proportionality and incorporate facial analysis into diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics. A Scopus literature search was conducted to identify the topics with the greatest research potential within digital orthodontics over the last five years. The most researched and cited topic was artificial intelligence and its applications in orthodontics. Apart from automated 2D or 3D cephalometric analysis, AI finds its application in facial analysis, decision-making algorithms as well as in the evaluation of treatment progress and retention. Together with AI, other digital advances are shaping the face of today’s orthodontics. Without any doubts, the era of “old” orthodontics is at its end, and modern, face-driven orthodontics is on the way to becoming a reality in modern orthodontic practices. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Cephalometric analysis has typically been used to evaluate lateral skull radiographs taken with a cephalostat to determine the skeletal pattern and assess treatment difficulties in orthodontics. Nowadays, Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data can be used for 3D cephalometrics. This study compares the performance of AI-automated cephalometric tracing with human-operated digital tracing using the Invivo 7.1.2 software on a sample of 120 scans evaluated by 5 observers (4 human and AI) for 14 cephalometric variables. Measurements were repeated for paired tests. ANOVA was used to minimize type I error. Normality of the data was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare measurement times between humans and AI. This study found that there were statistically significant differences between human observers and AI in 6 of 14 variables. The AI measurements were higher than the human measurements for these variables. The duration of measurements was also statistically significantly shorter for human observers than for AI. Now at the dawn of an era of AI-assisted diagnostics, we temporarily experience translational period of AI-automated algorithms being less accurate and slower than humans, albeit they will likely become the new normal in orthodontic treatment planning. This study also highlights the importance of rigorous scientific evaluation by independent researchers of incoming AI-automated cephalometric tracing solutions before they are considered clinically appropriate. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Aim The present study aimed to explore the perceptions of dental students regarding the ethical considerations associated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in clinical decision-making. Methods All the undergraduate clinical-year dental students were invited to take part in the study. A validated online questionnaire which consisted of 21 closed-ended questions (five-point Likert scales) was distributed to the students to evaluate their perceptions on the topic. Mean perception scores of the students from different years were analysed using a one-way ANOVA test, while independent t-tests were used to compare the scores between sexes. Results In total, 165 students participated in the present study. The mean age of the respondents was 23.3 (± 1.38) years and the majority were female, Chinese students. Respondents showed positive perceptions throughout all three domains. Uniform and comparable perceptions were seen across various academic years and sexes, with female respondents expressing stronger agreement regarding patient consent and privacy prioritisation. Conclusion Undergraduate clinical dental students generally showed positive perceptions regarding the ethical considerations associated with the integration of AI algorithms in clinical decision-making. It is essential to address these ethical considerations to ensure that AI benefits patient outcomes while upholding fundamental ethical principles and patient-centred care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the British Dental Association 2024.; The findings highlighted that dental students generally have positive perceptions regarding the ethical considerations of using AI algorithms in clinical decision-making. Female respondents showed stronger agreement regarding patient consent and privacy prioritisation, while slightly higher overall scores were noted among final-year dental students. The study suggested the need for dental educators to integrate lessons about patient rights and ethics into the curriculum to ensure future practitioners are well-prepared for responsible and ethical AI integration in dentistry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the British Dental Association 2024..

AB  - The localization of teeth and segmentation of periapical lesions in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are crucial tasks for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, which are often time-consuming and require a high level of expertise. However, automating these tasks is challenging due to variations in shape, size, and orientation of lesions, as well as similar topologies among teeth. Moreover, the small volumes occupied by lesions in CBCT images pose a class imbalance problem that needs to be addressed. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method utilizing two convolutional neural networks: the SpatialConfiguration-Net (SCN) and a modified version of the U-Net. The SCN accurately predicts the coordinates of all teeth present in an image, enabling precise cropping of teeth volumes that are then fed into the U-Net which detects lesions via segmentation. To address class imbalance, we compare the performance of three reweighting loss functions. After evaluation on 144 CBCT images, our method achieves a 97.3% accuracy for teeth localization, along with a promising sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively, for subsequent lesion detection. © 2024 by Paper published under CC license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

AB  - Featured Application: The aim of this article is to provide the reader with an overview of current applications of AI in orthodontics. Artificial intelligence (AI) has already arrived in many areas of our lives and, because of the increasing availability of computing power, can now be used for complex tasks in medicine and dentistry. This is reflected by an exponential increase in scientific publications aiming to integrate AI into everyday clinical routines. Applications of AI in orthodontics are already manifold and range from the identification of anatomical/pathological structures or reference points in imaging to the support of complex decision-making in orthodontic treatment planning. The aim of this article is to give the reader an overview of the current state of the art regarding applications of AI in orthodontics and to provide a perspective for the use of such AI solutions in clinical routine. For this purpose, we present various use cases for AI in orthodontics, for which research is already available. Considering the current scientific progress, it is not unreasonable to assume that AI will become an integral part of orthodontic diagnostics and treatment planning in the near future. Although AI will equally likely not be able to replace the knowledge and experience of human experts in the not-too-distant future, it probably will be able to support practitioners, thus serving as a quality-assuring component in orthodontic patient care. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery has gained significant attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of bibliometric reports that analyze the academic literature in this field to identify publishing and citation trends. By conducting an analysis of the top 100 most-cited articles on AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery, we aim to unveil popular research topics, key authors, institutions, countries, and journals in this area. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) electronic database to identify the top 100 most-cited articles on AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Publication and citation data were obtained and further analyzed and visualized using R Biblioshiny. The key domains of the 100 articles were also identified. Results: The top 100 most-cited articles were published between 2005 and 2022, contributed by 458 authors, with an average citation count of 22.09. South Korea emerged as the leading contributor with the highest number of publications (28) and citations (595), followed by China (16, 373), and the United States (7, 248). Notably, six South Korean authors ranked among the top 10 contributors, and three South Korean institutions were listed as the most productive. International collaborations were predominantly observed between the United States, China, and South Korea. The main domains of the articles focused on automated imaging assessment (42%), aiding diagnosis and treatment planning (34%), and the assessment of growth and development (10%). Besides, a positive correlation was observed between the testing sample size and citation counts (P = 0.010), as well as between the time of publication and citation counts (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The utilization of AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery has shown remarkable progress, particularly in the domains of imaging analysis, diagnosis and treatment planning, and growth and development assessment. This bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the top-cited articles and the trends of AI research in this field. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a more and more important role in our everyday life due to the advantages that it brings when used, such as 24/7 availability, a very low percentage of errors, ability to provide real time insights, or performing a fast analysis. AI is increasingly being used in clinical medical and dental healthcare analyses, with valuable applications, which include disease diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment planning, and drug discovery. This paper presents a narrative literature review of AI use in healthcare from a multi-disciplinary perspective, specifically in the cardiology, allergology, endocrinology, and dental fields. The paper highlights data from recent research and development efforts in AI for healthcare, as well as challenges and limitations associated with AI implementation, such as data privacy and security considerations, along with ethical and legal concerns. The regulation of responsible design, development, and use of AI in healthcare is still in early stages due to the rapid evolution of the field. However, it is our duty to carefully consider the ethical implications of implementing AI and to respond appropriately. With the potential to reshape healthcare delivery and enhance patient outcomes, AI systems continue to reveal their capabilities. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in constant, non-invasive monitoring of daily oral hygiene practices, potentially on behalf of a dentist or healthcare provider. This review summarises the evidence around the use of AI in the context of oral hygiene education. Data & sources: This scoping review was developed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review protocol guidelines and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Publications that involved the use of AI for oral hygiene education in any population and setting were included. A systematic electronic database search (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore, arXiv, Proquest, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PROSPERO) up to, and including 4 February 2023 was carried out. Citation searching from the full-text of included publications was also performed. Results: Of the 3215 publications screened, 20 were selected for qualitative synthesis. These were broadly divided into two categories of AI-assisted feedback: (1) synchronous and (2) asynchronous monitoring. There is a lack of high-quality studies, scarce reflection on possible ethical concerns on AI, and of studies comparing qualitative feedback to quantitative clinical outcomes with a control. Barriers to adoption of AI technologies, patient privacy, and specific areas for improvement were identified. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the use of AI to modify oral hygiene behaviour is promising. Further work is required in generating higher quality intra-oral images for dental biofilm detection, and in developing more personalised feedback for users. Clinical significance: This is the first review to map out the available literature on AI in providing oral hygiene education. It may be useful to dental researchers in appraising AI-assisted technologies in the context of oral health. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With increasing digitalization in orthodontics, certain orthodontic manufacturing processes such as the fabrication of indirect bonding trays, aligner production, or wire bending can be automated. However, orthodontic treatment planning and evaluation remains a specialist’s task and responsibility. As the prediction of growth in orthodontic patients and response to orthodontic treatment is inherently complex and individual, orthodontists make use of features gathered from longitudinal, multimodal, and standardized orthodontic data sets. Currently, these data sets are used by the orthodontist to make informed, rule-based treatment decisions. In research, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to assist orthodontists with the extraction of relevant data from such data sets. Here, AI has been applied for the analysis of clinical imagery, such as automated landmark detection in lateral cephalograms but also for evaluation of intraoral scans or photographic data. Furthermore, AI is applied to help orthodontists with decision support for treatment decisions such as the need for orthognathic surgery or for orthodontic tooth extractions. One major challenge in current AI research in orthodontics is the limited generalizability, as most studies use unicentric data with high risks of bias. Moreover, comparing AI across different studies and tasks is virtually impossible as both outcomes and outcome metrics vary widely, and underlying data sets are not standardized. Notably, only few AI applications in orthodontics have reached full clinical maturity and regulatory approval, and researchers in the field are tasked with tackling real-world evaluation and implementation of AI into the orthodontic workflow. © International Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research and American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 2024.

AB  - Caries grading plays a significant role for oral health management and treatment planning. Grading caries on panoramic image is a challenging task due to complication and diversity of gray distribution. In this paper, we proposed an automatic and visualized caries grading method for panoramic image using deep learning-based tooth anatomical segmentation and regions intersection judgment to achieve a consistent grading process with dentist. To achieve accurate semantic segmentation, a modified U-Net model by adding ASPP module and boundary loss is applied to segment caries, enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue region. Then a visualized process is conducted to judge the intersection of carious region and decision-making line for grading of shallow, medium, deep caries. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves promising grading performance. Moreover, we validated that our proposed two-stage caries grading method outperform deep learning classification models. Ablation analysis of anatomical segmentation performance was also investigated, and the compared results show that our proposed modified U-Net model can obtain more accurate region and boundary to improve grading results. Some mis-graded cases were finally detailed analyzed. Our proposed caries grading approach has great potential for clinical aided diagnosis and automatic chart filling on panoramic radiographs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Root canal curvature and calcification present challenges during root canal treatment, increasing the risk of procedural mishaps. These factors can jeopardize the management of intra-radicular infection leading to unfavourable treatment outcomes. The present research introduces an innovative approach that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance endodontic treatments. The study focuses on the development of a hybrid ensemble classifier, which combines multiple classification algorithms. By harnessing the strengths of these algorithms, the hybrid ensemble classifier improves the accuracy and robustness of classifying various endodontic challenges. The research also incorporates image segmentation techniques to isolate specific regions of interest, including teeth and roots, for further analysis. The segmentation process involves contrast enhancement, adaptive thresholding, contour detection and root segmentation. Through experimentation, the proposed approach demonstrates notable improvements in precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy and overall performance, ultimately refining endodontic treatments. The findings of this research contribute insights and advancements to treatment planning and decision-making processes in the field of endodontics, providing promising avenues for improving the management of endodontic treatments and achieving better treatment outcomes. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

AB  - Background: Gingival phenotype plays an important role in dental diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditionally, determining the gingival phenotype is done by manual probing of the gingival soft tissues, an invasive and time-consuming procedure. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an alternatively novel, non-invasive technology based on the precise 3-dimension (3D) soft tissue reconstruction from intraoral scanning and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to predict the gingival biotype. Methods: As a proof-of-concept, Yorkshire pig mandibles were scanned, and the CBCT data were fed into a deep-learning model to reconstruct the teeth and surrounding bone structure in 3D. By overlaying the CBCT scan with the intraoral scans, an accurate superposition was created and used for virtual measurements of the soft tissue thickness. Meanwhile, gingival thicknesses were also measured by a periodontal probe and digital caliper on the buccal and lingual sides at 3 mm apical to the gingival margin of the posterior teeth and compared with the virtual assessment at the same location. The data obtained from virtual and clinical measurements were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank analysis, while their correlation was determined by Pearson’s r value. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons of the amount of difference. Results: Among 108 investigated locations, the clinical and virtual measurements are strongly positively correlated (r = 0.9656, P < 0.0001), and only clinically insignificant differences (0.066 ± 0.223 mm) were observed between the two assessments. There is no difference in the agreement between the virtual and clinical measurements on sexually matured samples (0.087 ± 0.240 mm) and pre-pubertal samples (0.033 ± 0.195 mm). Noticeably, there is a greater agreement between the virtual and clinical measurements at the buccal sites (0.019 ± 0.233 mm) than at the lingual sites (0.116 ± 0.215 mm). Conclusion: In summary, the artificial intelligence-based virtual measurement proposed in this work provides an innovative technique potentially for accurately measuring soft tissue thickness using clinical routine 3D imaging systems, which will aid clinicians in generating a more comprehensive diagnosis with less invasive procedures and, in turn, optimize the treatment plans with more predictable outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various aspects of our lives, offering solutions to numerous problems and bridging gaps between reality and business. Within the realm of AI, emerging technologies such as machine learning and deep learning have become prominent in transforming the way we analyze data, make decisions, and address challenges. With the exponential growth of data usage and storage, these technologies have assumed a vital role in data analytics, storage management, and decision-making processes. As digital transformation continues to reshape industries and services worldwide, the healthcare sector, including oral health services, necessitates complete digitalization. Oral diseases, prevalent across all age groups, often go neglected until they reach a painful and severe stage, leading to potential tooth damage. To counteract such consequences, the field of dentistry requires digitalization for timely diagnosis, effective decision-making, patient management, and predictive capabilities. This research paper focuses on leveraging these emerging technologies to predict the progression of Periodontitis, a common oral disease. In this study, machine learning classifiers are employed to analyze and predict the disease. Additionally, cross-validation methods, feature extraction techniques, and ensemble learning strategies are implemented and evaluated. The performance metrics are compared for various classifiers including Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree classifiers. These classifiers are applied to a dataset of 1000 periodontitis patients, resulting in impressive accuracies of 95.5%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 99.5%, and 99% respectively, for the classification of chronic localized and chronic generalized periodontitis.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies play a significant role and significantly impact various sectors, including healthcare, engineering, sciences, and smart cities. AI has the potential to improve the quality of patient care and treatment outcomes while minimizing the risk of human error. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the dental industry, just like it is revolutionizing other sectors. It is used in dentistry to diagnose dental diseases and provide treatment recommendations. Dental professionals are increasingly relying on AI technology to assist in diagnosis, clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction across ten dental specialties. One of the most significant advantages of AI in dentistry is its ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing dental professionals with valuable insights to enhance their decision-making processes. The purpose of this paper is to identify the advancement of artificial intelligence algorithms that have been frequently used in dentistry and assess how well they perform in terms of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, treatment, and prognosis prediction in ten dental specialties; dental public health, endodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral medicine and pathology, oral & maxillofacial radiology, orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, prosthodontics, and digital dentistry in general. We will also show the pros and cons of using AI in all dental specialties in different ways. Finally, we will present the limitations of using AI in dentistry, which made it incapable of replacing dental personnel, and dentists, who should consider AI a complimentary benefit and not a threat.

AB  - Cephalometric landmark identification is a crucial and significant procedure that is generally used for orthodontic treatment planning and diagnosis. Computer-aided fully automated solutions can assist orthodontists and orthognathic surgeons' to precisely identify the landmarks from cephalograms more efficiently. Most of the existing research studies deployed Convolutional Neural Network models, transfer learning methods, and pre-trained architectures to predict the XY coordinates of landmarks from cephalometric radiographs. Deep learning architectures have achieved good results in accurately predicting landmarks compared to machine learning methodologies. In this paper, a custom CNN model integrated with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SEB) attention block named CephXNet architecture is proposed to automatically classify and predicts the XY coordinates of 19 landmarks from lateral cephalograms. The SEB block, which can adaptively refine information from various feature channels of X-ray images models the interdependence between the channels to enhance the discriminative features and suppress noise. The Squeeze-and-Excitation block incorporated with multiple Convolution and Max pooling layers enhances independent channel feature learning and thereby improves the representational power of the proposed CephXNet architecture. The proposed framework obtained an accuracy of 97.72% for 19 landmark classifications and has achieved 88.06% and 78.72% of Successful Detection Rate (SDR) in clinically accepted 2mm precision range for test1 and test2 datasets provided in the 2015 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) grand challenge for dental X-ray analysis conducted by IEEE. Furthermore, the proposed CephXNet is also tested with private clinical dataset comprised of 100 cephalograms collected from Solanki Dental Care Clinic in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The proposed CephXNet model obtained a classification accuracy of 90.08% and an average SDR of 73.94% in the 2mm precision range. The experimental outcomes show proposed CephXNet model is efficient and has great potential to deploy in clinical practice.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated the accuracy, consistency, and time-efficiency of a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based model for the automated maxillofacial bone segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Method: A dataset of 144 scans was acquired from two CBCT devices and randomly divided into three subsets: training set (n = 110), validation set (n = 10) and testing set (n = 24). A three-dimensional (3D) U-Net (CNN) model was developed, and the achieved automated segmentation was compared with a manual approach. Results: The average time required for automated segmentation was 39.1 s with a 204-fold decrease in time consumption compared to manual segmentation (132.7 min). The model was highly accurate for identification of the bony structures of the anatomical region of interest with a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 92.6%. Additionally, the fully deterministic nature of the CNN model was able to provide 100% consistency without any variability. The inter-observer consistency for expert-based minor correction of the automated segmentation observed an excellent DSC of 99.7%. Conclusion: The proposed CNN model provided a time-efficient, accurate, and consistent CBCT-based automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex. Clinical significance: Automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex could act as an alternative to the conventional segmentation techniques for improving the efficiency of the digital workflows. This approach could deliver accurate and ready-to-print3D models, essential to patient-specific digital treatment planning for orthodontics, maxillofacial surgery, and implant dentistry. © 2022

AB  - Panoramic dental radiography is a widely used diagnostic tool in dentistry that provides valuable information about a patient's oral health. These two-dimensional images of the entire upper and lower jaw offer a comprehensive view of the oral cavity and allow for the diagnosis of various conditions, including tooth decay, periodontal diseases, and jaw abnormalities. The use of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids for image enhancement is a common technique employed in this field. The GVF Snake technique, a computer vision approach, is utilized for dental radiograph analysis. It has proven effective in tasks such as tooth segmentation, root canal detection, and tooth movement analysis, improving the accuracy and efficiency of dental diagnosis and treatment planning. Manual annotation, model training, and deployment are facilitated by the computer vision platform Roboflow. The YOLOv8 training model, chosen for this research, has shown promising results with a precision of 82.36% in detecting and classifying dental diseases such as cavities, periodontal disease, and oral cancers. By training the model on a large dataset of dental radiographs, it can accurately identify different types of dental diseases, leading to early detection and more effective treatment. Overall, the integration of deep learning algorithms, image enhancement techniques, computer vision, and machine learning methods holds great potential in improving patient outcomes by enabling early detection, accurate diagnosis, and better management of dental conditions.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Diagnosis and treatment planning forms the crux of orthodontics, which orthodontists gain with years of expertise. Machine Learning (ML), having the ability to learn by pattern recognition, can gain this expertise in a very short duration, ensuring reduced error, inter–intra clinician variability and good accuracy. Thus, the aim of this study was to construct an ML predictive model to predict a broader outline of the orthodontic diagnosis and treatment plan. The sample consisted of 700 case records of orthodontically treated patients in the past ten years. The data were split into a training and a test set. There were 33 input variables and 11 output variables. Four ML predictive model layers with seven algorithms were created. The test set was used to check the efficacy of the ML-predicted treatment plan and compared with that of the decision made by the expert orthodontists. The model showed an overall average accuracy of 84%, with the Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGB classifier algorithms showing the highest accuracy ranging from 87–93%. Yet in their infancy stages, Machine Learning models could become a valuable Clinical Decision Support System in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: First we aimed to identify significant associations between preoperative risk factors and achieving optimal root filling length (RFL) during orthograde root canal treatments (RCT) and second to predict successful RFL using machine learning. Methods: Teeth receiving RCT at one university clinic from 2016-2020 with complete documentation were included. Successful RFL was defined to be 0-2mm of the apex, suboptimal RFL >2mm or beyond the apex. Logistic regression (logR) was used for association analyses; logR and more advanced machine learning (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)) were employed for predictive modeling. Results: 555 completed RCT (343 patients, female/male 32.1/67.9%) were included. In our association analysis (involving the full dataset), unsuccessful RFL was more likely in undergraduate students (US): OR 2.74, 95% CI [1.61, 4.75], p < 0.001), teeth with indistinct canal paths (OR 11.04, [2.87, 44.88], p < 0.001), root canals reduced in size (OR 2.56, [1.49, 4.46], p < 0.01), retreatments (OR 3.13, [1.6, 6.41], p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that dentists were more successful in mitigating risks than undergraduate students. Prediction of RFL on a separate testset was limitedly possible regardless of the machine learning approach. Conclusions: Achieving RFL is depending on the operator and several risk factors. The predictive performance on the technical outcome of a root canal treatment utilizing ML algorithms was insufficient. Clinical significance: Preoperative risk assessment is a relevant step in endodontic treatment planning. Single radiographic risk factors were significantly associated with achieving (or not achieving) optimal RFL and showed higher predictive value than a more complex risk assessment form. © 2022

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new breakthrough in technological advancements based on the concept of simulating human intelligence. These emerging technologies highly influence the diagnostic process in the field of medical sciences, with enhanced accuracy in diagnosis. This review article intends to report on the trends and application of AI models designed for diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics. A data search for the original research articles that were published over the last 22 years (from 1 January 2000 until 31 August 2022) was carried out in the most renowned electronic databases, which mainly included PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and Saudi Digital Library. A total of 56 articles that met the eligibility criteria were included. The research trend shows a rapid increase in articles over the last two years. In total: 17 articles have reported on AI models designed for the automated identification of cephalometric landmarks; 12 articles on the estimation of bone age and maturity using cervical vertebra and hand-wrist radiographs; two articles on palatal shape analysis; seven articles for determining the need for orthodontic tooth extractions; two articles for automated skeletal classification; and 16 articles for the diagnosis and planning of orthognathic surgeries. AI is a significant development that has been successfully implemented in a wide range of image-based applications. These applications can facilitate clinicians in diagnosing, treatment planning, and decision-making. AI applications are beneficial as they are reliable, with enhanced speed, and have the potential to automatically complete the task with an efficiency equivalent to experienced clinicians. These models can prove as an excellent guide for less experienced orthodontists. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To assess the accuracy of a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven tool for automated detection of teeth and small edentulous regions on Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images. Materials and Methods: After AI training and testing with 175 CBCT scans (130 for training and 40 for testing), validation was performed on a total of 46 CBCT scans selected for this purpose. Scans were split into fully dentate and partially dentate patients (small edentulous regions). The AI Driven tool (Virtual Patient Creator, Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium) automatically detected, segmented and labelled teeth and edentulous regions. Human performance served as clinical reference. Accuracy and speed of the AI-driven tool to detect and label teeth and edentulous regions in partially edentulous jaws were assessed. Automatic tooth segmentation was compared to manually refined segmentation and accuracy by means of Intersetion over Union (IoU) and 95% Hausdorff Distance served as a secondary outcome. Results: The AI-driven tool achieved a general accuracy of 99.7% and 99% for detection and labelling of teeth and missing teeth for both fully dentate and partially dentate patients, respectively. Automated detections took a median time of 1.5s, while the human operator median time was 98s (P<0.0001). Segmentation accuracy measured by Intersection over Union was 0.96 and 0.97 for fully dentate and partially edentulous jaws respectively. Conclusions: The AI-driven tool was accurate and fast for CBCT-based detection, segmentation and labelling of teeth and missing teeth in partial edentulism. Clinical Significance: The use of AI may represent a promising time-saving tool serving radiological reporting, with a major step forward towards automated dental charting, as well as surgical and treatment planning. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to assess patient-, tooth- and treatment-level covariates on the failure of root canal treatments (RT) and to predict failure using machine learning (ML). Methods: Teeth receiving RT at one large university hospital from 2016 to 2020 with a minimum follow-up of ≥6 months were included. Failure compromised absent radiographic healing and/or the presence of clinical symptoms. Covariates were selected on tooth-, treatment- and patient-level. We used logistic regression (logR) to determine associations in the full dataset, and logR as well as more advanced ML (random forests (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extremely gradient boosting (XGB)) for predictive modeling (area-under-the-receiver operating characteristic-curve (ROCAUC)) and testing on a separate test dataset. Results: 458 patients (female/male 47.2/52.8%) with 591 permanent teeth were included (overall success rate 79.5%). In logR, tooth-level covariates showed strong associations with failure: Alveolar bone loss 66–100% (ABL, OR 6.48, 95% CI [2.86, 14.89], p<0.001); Periapical index (PAI) score≥4 (OR 4.59, [2.44, 8.79], p<0.001); ABL 33–66% (OR 2.59 [1.49, 4.49], p<0.001); PAI=3 (OR 2.45, [1.43, 4.34], p<0.01); Treatment type “retreatment” (OR 1.77, [1.01, 2.86], p<0.01). On patient level only smoking (OR 2.05, [1.18, 3.53], p<0.05) was significantly associated with risk of failure. For predictive modeling, the predictive power of all models was limited (ROCAUC: logR 0.63, [0.53, 0.73]; GBM 0.59, [0.50, 0.68]; RF 0.59, [0.50, 0.68]; XGB 0.60, [0.50, 0.70]). Conclusions: Failure of RT was associated mainly with tooth-level covariates. Predicting failure was only limitedly possible, also with more complex ML. Clinical significance: Identifying specific risk factors for failure of RT and predicting the outcome of RT is relevant for treatment planning and informed shared decision-making. The present study found tooth-level factors to be associated with failure. Notably, predicting failure was only limitedly possible. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Imaging examinations are of remarkable importance for diagnostic support in Dentistry. Imaging techniques allow analysis of dental and maxillofacial tissues (e.g., bone, dentine, and enamel) that are inaccessible through clinical examination, which aids in the diagnosis of diseases as well as treatment planning. The analysis of imaging exams is not trivial; so, it is usually performed by oral and maxillofacial radiologists. The increasing demand for imaging examinations motivates the development of an automatic classification system for diagnostic support, as proposed in this paper, in which we aim to classify teeth as healthy or with endodontic lesion. The classification system was developed based on a Siamese Network combined with the use of convolutional neural networks with transfer learning for VGG-16 and DenseNet-121 networks. For this purpose, a database with 1000 sagittal and coronal sections of cone-beam CT scans was used. The results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, and F1-score show that the proposed system has a satisfactory classification performance. The innovative automatic classification system led to an accuracy of about 70%. The work is pioneer since, to the authors knowledge, no other previous work has used a Siamese Network for the purpose of classifying teeth as healthy or with endodontic lesion, based on cone-beam computed tomography images. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To compare the reliability of cephalometric landmark identification by an automated tracing software based on convolutional neural networks to human tracers. Materials and methods: Sixty cephalograms were traced by two board-certified orthodontists and AudaxCeph®’s artificial intelligence software. The following thirteen landmarks were identified in each tracing: Sella, Nasion, A point, B point, Porion, Menton, Pogonion, Orbitale, Gonion, Upper Central Incisor Incisal Edge (U1 Tip), Upper Central Incisor Root Apex (U1 apex), Lower Central Incisor Incisal Edge (L1 Tip), Lower Central Incisor Root Apex (L1 apex). An x–y axis was positioned in the bottom left corner of each cephalogram, and the x- and y-coordinates for the landmarks were exported into Excel. Distributions of landmarks (X, Y, radial distance) were compared using t-tests of equivalence with a 2 mm equivalence bound. These compared the AI position to the two orthodontists – and the orthodontists’ reliability by comparing equivalence against each other. Results: There was no statistical difference between the orthodontists and AudaxCeph®’s automatic tracing software except for the x- and y-dimension of Porion and the y-dimension of L1 apex. The two orthodontists had good intra-examiner reliability with no statistical difference found when comparing them. Conclusion: AudaxCeph®’s automated cephalometric tracing software is a good adjunctive tool to use when diagnosing and treatment planning orthodontic cases. © 2022 CEO

AB  - Aim: This study analyzed the self-perceived confidence of senior undergraduate dental students at the State University of Paraíba when performing different clinical procedures. Moreover, their future professional perspectives were also surveyed. Methods: A three-block semi-structured questionnaire provided information on the students’ profile (age, gender, marital status, etc.), degree of confidence (procedures/clinical situations), and professional perspectives (preferences and professional concerns). To study the results, a self-confidence index (SCI) was created, which represents the average of confidence values in the procedures questioned in the survey. Results: The students reported being more confident in providing oral hygiene instruction and performing composite restorations (class I or II), restorations and extractions in pediatric dentistry, and the selection of dental materials. By contrast, they lacked confidence in the diagnosis and treatment planning of TMD, periodontal surgery, diagnosis of oral lesions, the assistance of patients with systemic conditions, and surgical extraction of teeth with multiple roots. All study participants had an AI equal to or greater than 3 and were considered “confident” or “very confident”. The students showed a preference for working in the public service sector after graduating and were mostly concerned about low pay and their lack of knowledge in dental management. Conclusion: It was concluded, therefore, that the students showed a high level of self-confidence; however, they proved to be more confident in performing basic clinical procedures, while for more complex procedures, they were less confident. © 2022, Federal University of Minas Gerais Faculty of Dentistry.

AB  - Given the importance of 3D sensors, a fine-grained analysis on 3D dental model is an important task in computer-aided orthodontic treatment planning. Particularly, the real 3D dental model can intuitively show the shape and morphology of the tooth, but due to the irregularity of the 3D tooth data, it poses a challenge for accurate tooth segmentation. In this work, with the mesh data as input, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network, called MBESegNet, for accurate tooth segmentation on 3D dental models. On the one hand, to reduce the ambiguity of the mesh feature representation near the tooth boundary, MBESegNet learns the local context by enhancing the geometric and semantic features with a bidirectional and symmetric structure. On the other hand, MBESeg-Net hierarchically captures the multi-scale contextual features from different scales and represent the feature map following a coarse-to-fine feature fusion strategy for accurate tooth segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art 3D shape segmentation methods. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: The increasing collection of health data coupled with continuous IT advances have enabled precision medicine with personalized workflows. Traditionally, dentistry has lagged behind general medicine in the integration of new technologies: So what is the status quo of precision dentistry? The primary focus of this review is to provide a current overview of personalized workflows in the discipline of reconstructive dentistry (prosthodontics) and to highlight the disruptive potential of novel technologies for dentistry; the possible impact on society is also critically discussed. Material and methods: Narrative literature review. Results: Narrative literature review. Conclusions: In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI) will increase diagnostic accuracy, simplify treatment planning, and thus contribute to the development of personalized reconstructive workflows by analyzing e-health data to promote decision-making on an individual patient basis. Dental education will also benefit from AI systems for personalized curricula considering the individual students’ skills. Augmented reality (AR) will facilitate communication with patients and improve clinical workflows through the use of visually guided protocols. Tele-dentistry will enable opportunities for remote contact among dental professionals and facilitate remote patient consultations and post-treatment follow-up using digital devices. Finally, a personalized digital dental passport encoded using blockchain technology could enable prosthetic rehabilitation using 3D-printed dental biomaterials. Clinical significance: Overall, AI can be seen as the door-opener and driving force for the evolution from evidence-based prosthodontics to personalized reconstructive dentistry encompassing a synoptic approach with prosthetic and implant workflows. Nevertheless, ethical concerns need to be solved and international guidelines for data management and computing power must be established prior to a widespread routine implementation. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose. This study assessed the impact of intraoral scanner type, operator, and data augmentation on the dimensional accuracy of in vitro dental cast digital scans. It also evaluated the validation accuracy of an unsupervised machine-learning model trained with these scans. Methods. Twenty-two dental casts were scanned using two handheld intraoral scanners and one laboratory scanner, resulting in 110 3D cast scans across five independent groups. The scans underwent uniform augmentation and were validated using Hausdorff's distance (HD) and root mean squared error (RMSE), with the laboratory scanner as reference. A 3-factor analysis of variance examined interactions between scanners, operators, and augmentation methods. Scans were divided into training and validation sets and processed through a pretrained 3D visual transformer, and validation accuracy was assessed for each of the five groups. Results. No significant differences in HD and RMSE were found across handheld scanners and operators. However, significant changes in RMSE were observed between native and augmented scans with no specific interaction between scanner or operator. The 3D visual transformer achieved 96.2% validation accuracy for differentiating upper and lower scans in the augmented dataset. Native scans lacked volumetric depth, preventing their use for deep learning. Conclusion. Scanner, operator, and processing method did not significantly affect the dimensional accuracy of 3D scans for unsupervised deep learning. However, data augmentation was crucial for processing intraoral scans in deep learning algorithms, introducing structural differences in the 3D scans. Clinical Significance. The specific type of intraoral scanner or the operator has no substantial influence on the quality of the generated 3D scans, but controlled data augmentation of the native scans is necessary to obtain reliable results with unsupervised deep learning.  © 2023 Taseef Hasan Farook et al.

AB  - Background and objectives: Analyzing three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images has become an indispensable procedure for diagnosis and treatment planning of orthodontic patients. Artificial intelligence, especially deep-learning techniques for analyzing image data, shows great potential for medical and dental image analysis and diagnosis. To explore the feasibility of automating measurement of 13 geometric parameters from three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography images taken in natural head position (NHP), this study proposed a smart system that combined a facial profile analysis algorithm with deep-learning models. Materials and methods: Using multiple views extracted from the cone beam computed tomography data of 170 cases as a dataset, our proposed method automatically calculated 13 dental parameters by partitioning, detecting regions of interest, and extracting the facial profile. Subsequently, Mask-RCNN, a trained decentralized convolutional neural network was applied to detect 23 landmarks. All the techniques were integrated into a software application with a graphical user interface designed for user convenience. To demonstrate the system's ability to replace human experts, 30 CBCT data were selected for validation. Two orthodontists and one advanced general dentist located required landmarks by using a commercial dental program. The differences between manual and developed methods were calculated and reported as the errors. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for intra-observer reliability were 0.98 (0.97–0.99) for observer 1; 0.95 (0.93–0.97) for observer 2; 0.98 (0.97–0.99) for observer 3 after measuring 13 parameters two times at two weeks interval. The combined ICC for intra-observer reliability was 0.97. The ICCs and 95% CI for inter-observer reliability were 0.94 (0.91–0.97). The mean absolute value of deviation was around 1 mm for the length parameters, and smaller than 2° for angle parameters. Furthermore, ANOVA test demonstrated the consistency between the measurements of the proposed method and those of human experts statistically (Fdis=2.68, ɑ=0.05). Conclusions: The proposed system demonstrated the high consistency with the manual measurements of human experts and its applicability. This method aimed to help human experts save time and efforts for analyzing three-dimensional CBCT images of orthodontic patients. © 2022

AB  - Objectives: This review aims to share the current developments of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the field of medico-dental diagnostics of the face. The primary focus of this review is to present the applicability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to interpret medical images, together with the associated opportunities, obstacles, and ethico-legal concerns. Material and methods: Narrative literature review. Results: Narrative literature review. Conclusion: Curated facial images are widely available and easily accessible and are as such particularly suitable big data for ANN training. New AI solutions have the potential to change contemporary dentistry by optimizing existing processes and enriching dental care with the introduction of new tools for assessment or treatment planning. The analyses of health-related big data may also contribute to revolutionize personalized medicine through the detection of previously unknown associations. In regard to facial images, advances in medico-dental AI-based diagnostics include software solutions for the detection and classification of pathologies, for rating attractiveness and for the prediction of age or gender. In order for an ANN to be suitable for medical diagnostics of the face, the arising challenges regarding computation and management of the software are discussed, with special emphasis on the use of non-medical big data for ANN training. The legal and ethical ramifications of feeding patients’ facial images to a neural network for diagnostic purposes are related to patient consent, data privacy, data security, liability, and intellectual property. Current ethico-legal regulation practices seem incapable of addressing all concerns and ensuring accountability. Clinical significance: While this review confirms the many benefits derived from AI solutions used for the diagnosis of medical images, it highlights the evident lack of regulatory oversight, the urgent need to establish licensing protocols, and the imperative to investigate the moral quality of new norms set with the implementation of AI applications in medico-dental diagnostics. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of a new deep-learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for diagnostic charting in panoramic radiography. Methods: One thousand eighty-four anonymous dental panoramic radiographs were labeled by two dento-maxillofacial radiologists for ten different dental situations: crown, pontic, root-canal treated tooth, implant, implant-supported crown, impacted tooth, residual root, filling, caries, and dental calculus. AI Model CranioCatch, developed in Eskişehir, Turkey and based on a deep CNN method, was proposed to be evaluated. A Faster R-CNN Inception v2 (COCO) model implemented with the TensorFlow library was used for model development. The assessment of AI model performance was evaluated with sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. Results: When the performance of the proposed AI model for detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs was evaluated, the best sensitivity values were obtained from the crown, implant, and impacted tooth as 0.9674, 0.9615, and 0.9658, respectively. The worst sensitivity values were obtained from the pontic, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.7738, 0.3026, and 0.0934, respectively. The best precision values were obtained from pontic, implant, implant-supported crown as 0.8783, 0.9259, and 0.8947, respectively. The worst precision values were obtained from residual root, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.6764, 0.5096, and 0.1923, respectively. The most successful F1 Scores were obtained from the implant, crown, and implant-supported crown, as 0.9433, 0.9122, and 0.8947, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed AI model has promising results at detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs, except for caries and dental calculus. Thanks to the improvement of AI models in all areas of dental radiology, we predict that they will help physicians in panoramic diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as digital-based student education, especially during the pandemic period. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Dentistry is probably one of the oldest disciplines of medicine and is primarily a manual technique, based both on visual observation and on the use of multiple instruments to treat the teeth. Today, AI has indeed the possibility to revolutionize the way dentists work, by allowing them to make better diagnoses, to implement treatment planning and to reduce error in daily practice, in order to improve the patient care. AI applications can also help the analysis of the relationship between the prevention and the treatment techniques. During the last few years, a tremendous amount of AI applications has been developed in various dental specialties like orthodontics, oral radiology, periodontics, prosthetic dentistry, conservative dentistry, endodontics or even forensic odontology. In a sense, given this current technological revolution in dentistry, a question is worth asking: given the progress made by artificial intelligence in dentistry, will we still need dentists in a few decades? In this chapter, the main areas of dentistry are reviewed, considering the effects, limitations and perspectives of AI technologies on them. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - With a wide range of applications in cosmetic dentistry treatments, and treatment planning, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is having a growing influence in the field of dentistry and is enhancing the growth of digital tools and technology. The surgical sector, automatic disease diagnosis, and recently established customized medicine are just a few of the disciplines that might benefit from AI support. Personalized medicine provides the inclination to diseases, diagnosis, and selection of the best treatment for a specific individual. In fields like image processing, deep learning has been able to match and improve human performance for exceedingly complicated tasks such as object detection models with classification, and prediction capabilities and for the identification of numerous dental diseases and their differential treatments. Many of these neural network applications face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled medical datasets, and oral disease datasets are no exception. This pilot study makes it possible to identify various dental diseases and the treatments for them by utilizing a dataset of 664 dental panoramic X-ray images which is considered a small number. These images have been used for training after being manually labeled for 9 separate classes. You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5, a one-step search method primarily utilized for real-time object detection, is the deep neural network that was used in this study. Bounding boxes helped identify six differential treatments and three classes of dental diseases. Results show that this strategy was able to attain a Precision of 1.00, F1 score of 0.74, Recall of 0.83, and mAP of 72.4 percent by training with this smaller number of images, which shows tremendous potential for dentists and radiologists. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more important in medicine and in dentistry. It can be helpful in many fields where the human may be assisted and helped by new technologies. Neural networks are a part of artificial intelligence, and are similar to the human brain in their work and can solve given problems and make fast decisions. This review shows that artificial intelligence and the use of neural networks has developed very rapidly in recent years, and it may be an ordinary tool in modern dentistry in the near future. The advantages of this process are better efficiency, accuracy, and time saving during the diagnosis and treatment planning. More research and improvements are needed in the use of neural networks in dentistry to put them into daily practice and to facilitate the work of the dentist. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Predicting tooth loss is a persistent clinical challenge in the 21st century. While an emerging field in dentistry, computational solutions that employ machine learning are promising for enhancing clinical outcomes, including the chairside prognostication of tooth loss. We aimed to evaluate the risk of bias in prognostic prediction models of tooth loss that use machine learning. To do this, literature was searched in two electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed; Google Scholar) for studies that reported the accuracy or area under the curve (AUC) of prediction models. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. Although both development and validation were included in this review, studies that did not assess the accuracy or validation of boosting models (AdaBoosting, Gradient-boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were excluded. Five studies met criteria for inclusion and revealed high accuracy; however, models displayed a high risk of bias. Importantly, patient-level assessments combined with socioeconomic predictors performed better than clinical predictors alone. While there are current limitations, machine-learning-assisted models for tooth loss may enhance prognostication accuracy in combination with clinical and patient metadata in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Dental implants are widely used to restore missing teeth because of their stability and comfort characteristics. Peri-implant infection may lead to implant failure and other profound consequences. It is believed that peri-implantitis is closely related to the formation of biofilms, which are difficult to remove once formed. Therefore, endowing titanium implants with anti-adhesion properties is an effective method to prevent peri-implant infection. Moreover, anti-adhesion strategies for titanium implant surfaces are critical steps for resisting bacterial adherence. This article reviews the process of bacterial adhesion, the material properties that may affect the process, and the anti-adhesion strategies that have been proven effective and promising in practice. This article intends to be a reference for further improvement of the antibacterial adhesion strategy in clinical application and for related research on titanium implant surfaces. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Accurately segmenting teeth and identifying the corresponding anatomical landmarks on dental mesh models are essential in computer-aided orthodontic treatment. Manually performing these two tasks is time-consuming, tedious, and, more importantly, highly dependent on orthodontists' experiences due to the abnormality and large-scale variance of patients' teeth. Some machine learning-based methods have been designed and applied in the orthodontic field to automatically segment dental meshes (e.g., intraoral scans). In contrast, the number of studies on tooth landmark localization is still limited. This paper proposes a two-stage framework based on mesh deep learning (called TS-MDL) for joint tooth labeling and landmark identification on raw intraoral scans. Our TS-MDL first adopts an end-to-end iMeshSegNet method (i.e., a variant of the existing MeshSegNet with both improved accuracy and efficiency) to label each tooth on the downsampled scan. Guided by the segmentation outputs, our TS-MDL further selects each tooth's region of interest (ROI) on the original mesh to construct a light-weight variant of the pioneering PointNet (i.e., PointNet-Reg) for regressing the corresponding landmark heatmaps. Our TS-MDL was evaluated on a real-clinical dataset, showing promising segmentation and localization performance. Specifically, iMeshSegNet in the first stage of TS-MDL reached an averaged Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) at ${0.964}\pm {0.054}$ , significantly outperforming the original MeshSegNet. In the second stage, PointNet-Reg achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of ${0}.{597}\pm {0}.{761} \, mm$ in distances between the prediction and ground truth for 66 landmarks, which is superior compared with other networks for landmark detection. All these results suggest the potential usage of our TS-MDL in orthodontics.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This scientific article proposal explores the potential benefits of using artificial intelligence (AI) in prosthodontic restoration to achieve predictable and safer dental outcomes. Prosthodontic restoration involves designing, fabricating, and placing dental prostheses to restore oral function and aesthetics. Although traditional prosthodontic techniques have evolved significantly, incorporating AI into the workflow can revolutionize the field by enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and patient satisfaction. The proposed study aims to investigate the integration of AI algorithms and techniques into various stages of prosthodontic restoration, including treatment planning, digital impression acquisition, prosthesis design, and fabrication. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and image processing, AI can assist in diagnosing dental conditions, predicting treatment outcomes, and optimizing prosthesis design to ensure optimal fit and function. This technology can also aid in identifying potential challenges and risks before proceeding with the restorative procedures, minimizing errors, and improving patient safety. Furthermore, AI-powered systems can facilitate real-time assessment and feedback during fabrication, ensuring precise milling or 3D printing of prosthetic materials. These advancements have the potential to streamline workflows, reduce human error, and shorten treatment times, ultimately leading to enhanced treatment outcomes and increased patient satisfaction. The proposed research methodology includes a comprehensive literature review, an analysis of existing AI applications in prosthodontic restoration, and the development of a prototype AI-assisted system for prosthesis design and fabrication. The evaluation of this prototype will involve quantitative and qualitative assessments, comparing its performance with traditional methods. Overall, this article proposal seeks to highlight the transformative role of AI in prosthodontic restoration, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize traditional approaches and deliver predictable and safer dentistry. The findings from this research can contribute to advancing dental technology, fostering innovation, and improving patient care in prosthodontics. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: In this study, we investigated the feasibility of leveraging different machine learning methods to help with clinical decision-making on orthodontic treatment planning, including the decision on extraction, extraction pattern and anchorage pattern.Setting and Sample Population: a group of 216 patients (156 extraction and 60 non-extraction) was enrolled.Materials and Methods: 32 input features were identified and used as the input variable. We proposed 7 machine learning methods including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian NB, KNN Classifier and Neural Network for extraction and 2 methods including Random forest and Neural Network for extraction and anchorage pattern.Results: For extraction decision, neural network yielded the most promising results by 93 % accuracy followed by Logistic regression (86 % accuracy and 93% precision), SVM and Random Forest (83 % accuracy and 90% precision). Naïve Bayesian classifier and KNN classifier failed to produce accuracy within the acceptable range but Naïve Bayes demonstrated the highest recall score with 92 %. For the decision on extraction & anchorage pattern neural network proved to be more reliable with 89 % accuracy on extraction pattern and 81% accuracy on extraction& anchorage pattern. Random Forest classifier with 41% accuracy did not show satisfactory results for this task. The most important features for decision on extraction in this study were Inter incisal angle, crowding in mandible, U1-FH, L1-NB and crowding in maxilla.Conclusion: The results demonstrate that neural network can yield considerable accuracy in a medical diagnosis model. However, other algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest can also be considered for simpler tasks such as extraction. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The computer-assisted radiologic informative report has received increasing research attention to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning for dental care providers. However, manual interpretation of dental images is limited, expensive, and time-consuming. Another barrier in dental imaging is the limited number of available images for training, which is a challenge in the era of deep learning. This study proposes a novel self-distillation (SD) enhanced self-supervised learning on top of the masked image modeling (SimMIM) Transformer, called SD-SimMIM, to improve the outcome with a limited number of dental radiographs. In addition to the prediction loss on masked patches, SD-SimMIM computes the self-distillation loss on the visible patches. We apply SD-SimMIM on dental panoramic X-rays for teeth numbering, detection of dental restorations and orthodontic appliances, and instance segmentation tasks. Our results show that SD-SimMIM outperforms other self-supervised learning methods. Furthermore, we augment and improve the annotation of an existing dataset of panoramic X-rays. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to work like humans. The concept initially began with the advent of mathematical models which gave calculated outputs based on inputs fed into the system. This was later modified with the introduction of various algorithms which can either give output based on overall data analysis or by selection of information within previous data. It is steadily becoming a favoured mode of treatment due to its efficiency and ability to manage complex conditions in all specialities. In dentistry, artificial intelligence has also popularised over the past few decades. They have been found useful for diagnosis in restorative dentistry, oral pathology and oral surgery. In orthodontics, they have been utilised for diagnosis, assessment of treatment needs, cephalometrics, treatment planning and orthognathic surgeries etc. The current literature review was planned to highlight the uses of artificial intelligence in dentistry, specifically in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. © 2022 Pakistan Medical Association.

AB  - Objective. Recently, dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) methods have been improved to significantly reduce radiation dose while maintaining image resolution with minimal equipment cost. In low-dose CBCT environments, metallic inserts such as implants, crowns, and dental fillings cause severe artifacts, which result in a significant loss of morphological structures of teeth in reconstructed images. Such metal artifacts prevent accurate 3D bone-teeth-jaw modeling for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the performance of existing metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods in handling the loss of the morphological structures of teeth in reconstructed CT images remains relatively limited. In this study, we developed an innovative MAR method to achieve optimal restoration of anatomical details. Approach. The proposed MAR approach is based on a two-stage deep learning-based method. In the first stage, we employ a deep learning network that utilizes intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and performs multi-task learning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. The network is designed to improve the learning ability of capturing teeth-related features effectively while mitigating metal artifacts. In the second stage, a 3D bone-teeth-jaw model is constructed with weighted thresholding, where the weighting region is determined depending on the geometry of the intra-oral scan data. Main results. The results of numerical simulations and clinical experiments are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Significance. We propose for the first time a MAR method using radiation-free intra-oral scan data as supplemental information on the tooth morphological structures of teeth, which is designed to perform accurate 3D bone-teeth-jaw modeling in low-dose CBCT environments. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: To develop and validate models based on logistic regression and artificial intelligence for prognostic prediction of molar survival in periodontally affected patients. Materials and Methods: Clinical and radiographic data from four different centres across four continents (two in Europe, one in the United States, and one in China) including 515 patients and 3157 molars were collected and used to train and test different types of machine-learning algorithms for their prognostic ability of molar loss over 10 years. The following models were trained: logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbours, decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network, gradient boosting, and naive Bayes. In addition, different models were aggregated by means of the ensembled stacking method. The primary outcome of the study was related to the prediction of overall molar loss (MLO) in patients after active periodontal treatment. Results: The general performance in the external validation settings (aggregating three cohorts) revealed that the ensembled model, which combined neural network and logistic regression, showed the best performance among the different models for the prediction of MLO with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.726. The neural network model showed the best AUC of 0.724 for the prediction of periodontitis-related molar loss. In addition, the ensembled model showed the best calibration performance. Conclusions: Through a multi-centre collaboration, both prognostic models for the prediction of molar loss were developed and externally validated. The ensembled model showed the best performance in terms of both discrimination and validation, and it is made freely available to clinicians for widespread use in clinical practice. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The classification of cervical vertebrae maturity (CVM) plays a crucial role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. This study aims to evaluate the performances of bone maturity classification using three convolutional neural network architectures. The dataset used in this study utilizes the CVM-900 dataset which contains labeled cervical vertebrae x-ray images in 6 levels of bone maturation. Preprocessing was conducted by ROI cropping which results in three datasets: Crop C2-C4, Crop C2-C6, and uncrop. Then, to decrease the possibility of overfitting, the datasets are augmented with random translation and rotation. This work compares three pre-trained networks: ResNet-101, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3. Each network has unique characteristics to improve performance in deep learning. Visual explanations of CVM stage classification from each model are conducted through Grad-CAM which leverages the gradient information to the target classes. We found that InceptionResNetV2 yields the highest accuracy across models and ROIs. It is shown that ROI affects model's performance. However, due to overfitting and the inability of our model to infer multiscale features, the increase in accuracy is not as significant. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Periodontitis is an inflammation of the supporting structures of teeth, involving progressive alveolar bone loss. A computer-assisted detection system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was developed. This study aimed to assess the existing literature to determine the accuracy of the CNNs for diagnosing and measuring periodontal bone loss (PBL). We used a modified approach to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension diagnostic test accuracy by searching the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science, in addition to gray literature. Medical Subject Headings terms and Keywords in the title and abstract fields, as well as subject headings for both periodontal disease/bone loss and CNN/artificial intelligence, were used to search the existing literature for publications relevant to the evaluation of the accuracy of CNN for the detection and measurement of alveolar bone loss over the past three decades (January 1990-May 2021). Quality analysis was performed using the quality assessment and diagnostic accuracy tool-2. Four thousand six hundred and ninety potentially relevant titles and abstracts were found after an initial electronic and manual search and removal of duplicates. Applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded 75 publications, which were further analyzed for relevance and applicability. Most of the included studies were observational. Following the critical analysis, eight publications were used to assess CNN's precision of the CNN for PBL measurements. The CNN system successfully determined PBL. Therefore, it can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning for dentists in the future. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of teeth is crucial for effective treatment planning. Previous approaches attempted to segment a tooth as a whole, which has limitations because most treatments involve internal structures of teeth. In this paper, we propose fully automated segmentation of internal tooth structure, including enamel, dentin, and pulp, which is the first attempt to the best of our knowledge. The task is challenging, because a total of 96 classes of tooth structures need to be identified from a CBCT image. We design a 3-stage process of coarse-to-fine segmentation of tooth structures without compromising the original resolution. We propose Dual-Hierarchy U-Net (DHU-Net) in order to capture hierarchical structures of teeth, and to effectively fuse encoder and decoder features from higher and lower hierarchies. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both tasks of segmenting the whole tooth and internal tooth structure. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - The chapter deals with the possibilities that artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) provide in everyday dental practice and education, as well as the possibilities for the advancement of this technology in the future. The implementation of augmented reality and virtual reality in AI-powered dental technologies are rapidly evolving into applicable solutions for clinical practice and bridging the gap between the digital and physical world. The development of AR is leading to the development of a new field in dentistry, which can be called “augmented dentistry” that allows the use of new dental technologies to improve various aspects of clinical practice, virtual treatment planning, and the evaluation and modification of virtual treatment outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Computer-aided systems are widely used in digital dentistry to help human experts for accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, we study the problem of tooth defect segmentation in 3-Dimensional (3D) mesh scans, which is a prerequisite task in many dental applications. Existing models usually perform poorly in this task due to the highly imbalanced characteristic of tooth defects. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel triple-stream graph convolutional network named TripleNet to learn multi-scale geometric features from mesh scans for end-to-end tooth defect segmentation. With predefined geometrical features as inputs and a focal loss for training guidance, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3D tooth defect segmentation. Our work exhibits the great potential of artificial intelligence for future digital dentistry. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Personalized medicine refers to the tailoring of diagnostics and therapeutics to individuals based on one’s biological, social, and behavioral characteristics. While personalized dental medicine is still far from being a reality, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with improved data analytic approaches are expected to integrate diverse data from the individual, setting, and system levels, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the interaction of these multilevel data and therefore bring us closer to more personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry, also known as P4 dentistry. In the field of dentomaxillofacial imaging, a wide range of AI applications, including several commercially available software options, have been proposed to assist dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of various dentomaxillofacial diseases, with performance similar or even superior to that of specialists. Notably, the impact of these dental AI applications on treatment decision, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness has so far been assessed sparsely. Such information should be further investigated in future studies to provide patients, providers, and healthcare organizers a clearer picture of the true usefulness of AI in daily dental practice. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Cephalometric analysis plays an important role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. It depends on the detection of multiple landmarks, while the process is time-consuming and tedious. Although some deep learning-based automatic landmark detection algorithms have achieved excellent performance, most of them adopt multi-stage models increasing the complexity and detection time. Meanwhile, few studies focused on the uncertainty of detection results, thereby ignoring its significant clinical value. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on heatmap regression for landmark detection, which can achieve competitive accuracy and good robustness with only one step. Furthermore, by applying Monte Carlo dropout to a U-shaped convolutional neural network, we can obtain not only the coordinate of each landmark but also the corresponding simple uncertainty, so that doctors can pay more attention to those landmarks with higher uncertainty. The evaluation results showed the mean radial error is 1.39±1.06mm and the average successful detection rate is 79.65%, 97.22% within 2mm, 4mm for the IEEE ISBI2015 Test Dataset 1, the indicators for the IEEE ISBI2015 Test Dataset 2 are 1.33±0.93mm, 80.05% and 97.53%, respectively. Our method has the potential to become an assistant tool in clinical practice. Automatic and accurate detection with uncertainty analysis is expected to help guide the doctor's judgment. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare genetic disease affecting both dentitions. Factors such as age, socioeconomic status, dentition and AI type and severity should be taken into consideration in treatment planning. Aim: This retrospective study aimed to assess the survival rate of AI main restorative options and the effects of gender and dentition type. Methods: The study sample comprised 28 dental records of patients aged 5-17 years affected by AI (15 females, 13 males) and with anterior and/or posterior restoration in primary and/or permanent tooth/teeth. The fate of each restoration was classified into three categories: failed, withdrawn and censored and analyzed by the life table method of survival analysis. Results: Out of 233 restorations performed, the most frequently used restoration was preformed metal crowns (PMCs), followed by anterior composite, posterior composite, adhesive casting, Ketac fill and amalgam respectively. The two main restorations, PMCs and anterior composite were included in the statistical analysis. The survival rate of PMCs was significantly higher than anterior composite (p<0.001). The anterior composite restorations survived significantly longer in males (p<0.05). Females had significantly better survival rate of PMCs (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant effect of the operator group of restoration survival. Conclusion: The anterior composite restorations survived significantly longer in males and females had significantly better survival rate of PMCs than males. © 2023 UPM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cephalometric tracing is widely used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Since manual landmark lo-calization suffers from severe inter-observer and intra-observer inconsistency, a large number of efforts have been made by researchers to develop automatic localization methods. However, most of the existing methods are developed based on rules which sample uniformly from origin images rather than with the highest density in a focal point and ignore intermediate layers' results in their networks or their outputs' channels. To address the issue, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on multi-scale and multi-channel attention to identify landmarks. The channel attention network is first trained by multi-scale image patches cropped from 100 Cephalograms, and then enhanced by cross-layer connections to extract high-level features, finally involved in the collaboration with a three-layer MLP module to accurately locate coordinates. We conduct extensive evaluation on a real cephalometric X-ray data-set and a Non-public dataset, both achieve promising performance improvements especially in terms of high-precision detection. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to develop an automatic pipeline for analyzing mandibular shape asymmetry in 3-dimensions. Methods: Forty patients with skeletal Class I pattern and 80 patients with skeletal Class III pattern were used. The mandible was automatically segmented from the cone-beam computed tomography images using a U-net deep learning network. A total of 17,415 uniformly sampled quasi-landmarks were automatically identified on the mandibular surface via a template mapping technique. After alignment with the robust Procrustes superimposition, the pointwise surface-to-surface distance between original and reflected mandibles was visualized in a color-coded map, indicating the location of asymmetry. The degree of overall mandibular asymmetry and the asymmetry of subskeletal units were scored using the root-mean-squared-error between the left and right sides. These asymmetry parameters were compared between the skeletal Class I and skeletal Class III groups. Results: The mandible shape was significantly more asymmetrical in patients with skeletal Class III pattern with positional asymmetry. The condyles were identified as the most asymmetric region in all groups, followed by the coronoid process and the ramus. Conclusions: This automated approach to quantify mandibular shape asymmetry will facilitate high-throughput image processing for big data analysis. The spatially-dense landmarks allow for evaluating mandibular asymmetry over the entire surface, which overcomes the information loss inherent in conventional linear distance or angular measurements. Precise quantification of the asymmetry can provide important information for individualized diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. © 2022

AB  - The accurate diagnosis of individual tooth prognosis has to be determined comprehensively in consideration of the broader treatment plan. The objective of this study was to establish an effective artificial intelligence (AI)-based module for an accurate tooth prognosis decision based on the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) comprehensive treatment planning curriculum (CTPC). The tooth prognosis of 2359 teeth from 94 cases was evaluated with 1 to 5 levels (1—Hopeless, 5—Good condition for long term) by two groups (Model-A with 16, and Model-B with 13 examiners) based on 17 clinical determining factors selected from the HSDM-CTPC. Three AI machine-learning methods including gradient boosting classifier, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier were used to create an algorithm. These three methods were evaluated against the gold standard data determined by consensus of three experienced prosthodontists, and their accuracy was analyzed. The decision tree classifier indicated the highest accuracy at 0.8413 (Model-A) and 0.7523 (Model-B). Accuracy with the gradient boosting classifier and the random forest classifier was 0.6896, 0.6687, and 0.8413, 0.7523, respectively. Overall, the decision tree classifier had the best accuracy among the three methods. The study contributes to the implementation of AI in the decision-making process of tooth prognosis in consideration of the treatment plan. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Introduction: The role of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently increasing in terms of diagnosing diseases and planning treatment in endodontics. However, findings from individual research studies are not systematically reviewed and compiled together. Hence, this study aimed to systematically review, appraise, and evaluate neural AI algorithms employed and their comparative efficacy to conventional methods in endodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Methods: The present research question focused on the literature search about different AI algorithms and models of AI assisted endodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. The search engine included databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct with search criteria of primary research paper, published in English, and analyzed data on AI and its role in the field of endodontics. Results: The initial search resulted in 785 articles, exclusion based on abstract relevance, animal studies, grey literature and letter to editors narrowed down the scope of selected articles to 11 accepted for review. The review data supported the findings that AI can play a crucial role in the area of endodontics, such as identification of apical lesions, classifying and numbering teeth, detecting dental caries, periodontitis and periapical disease, diagnosing different dental problems, helping dentists make referrals, and also helping them make plans for treatment of dental disorders in a timely and effective manner with greater accuracy. Conclusion: AI with different models or frameworks and algorithms can help dentists to diagnose and manage endodontic problems with greater accuracy. However, endodontic fraternity needs to provide more emphasis on the utilization of AI, provision of evidence based guidelines and implementation of the AI models. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of various skeletal and dental cephalometric parameters as produced by different commercial providers that make use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted automated cephalometric analysis and to compare their quality to a gold standard established by orthodontic experts. Methods: Twelve experienced orthodontic examiners pinpointed 15 radiographic landmarks on a total of 50 cephalometric X‑rays. The landmarks were used to generate 9 parameters for orthodontic treatment planning. The “humans’ gold standard” was defined by calculating the median value of all 12 human assessments for each parameter, which in turn served as reference values for comparisons with results given by four different commercial providers of automated cephalometric analyses (DentaliQ.ortho [CellmatiQ GmbH, Hamburg, Germany], WebCeph [AssembleCircle Corp, Seongnam-si, Korea], AudaxCeph [Audax d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia], CephX [Orca Dental AI, Herzliya, Israel]). Repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were calculated and Bland–Altman plots were generated for comparisons. Results: The results of the repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant differences between the commercial providers’ predictions and the humans’ gold standard for all nine investigated parameters. However, the pairwise comparisons also demonstrate that there were major differences among the four commercial providers. While there were no significant mean differences between the values of DentaliQ.ortho and the humans’ gold standard, the predictions of AudaxCeph showed significant deviations in seven out of nine parameters. Also, the Bland–Altman plots demonstrate that a reduced precision of AI predictions must be expected especially for values attributed to the inclination of the incisors. Conclusion: Fully automated cephalometric analyses are promising in terms of timesaving and avoidance of individual human errors. At present, however, they should only be used under supervision of experienced clinicians. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Technology is rapidly evolving in the modern world, and the accompanying developments due to its influence are shaping each and every aspect of our life, with the field of orthodontics being no exception. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine such trends in orthodontics and hypothesize which ones would emerge and continue in the near future. After a thorough search of online journals using keywords such as “3D printing,” “Aligners,” “Artificial intelligence,” “Future trends,” “Orthodontics,” and “Teleorthodontics” across databases of PubMed-MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus, a total of 634 papers were initially recovered. Technological advancements in 3D printing, Computer-aided design and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), biopolymers and Teleorthodontics were the most important categories of development seen across the 17 studies that we selected for our review. All the investigations selected for this systematic review depicted aspects of orthodontics that were influenced by rapid technological changes and could potentially become mainstream in the coming times. However, caution was sought to be observed in the usage/adoption of some of these trends, with social media usage amongst both patients as well as orthodontists being a prime example of this. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in medical imaging. There are a plethora of potential applications, covering every stage of the medical imaging life cycle from image creation to diagnosis to outcome prognosis. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is having a rising influence in the field of dentistry and is improving the growth of digital tools and technology, with a wide range of applications in cosmetic dental treatments and treatment planning. Deep learning has been able to match and improve human performance in fields such as image processing for extremely complex tasks such as object detection models with classification and prediction capabilities, as well as the identification of numerous dental diseases and their differential treatments. The lack of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data with expert labeling (eg, annotations) is one of the main barriers to the development and clinical application of AI algorithms. This pilot study used a dataset of 664 dental panoramic X-ray images to build a model that can detect dental diseases and the differential treatments present on a full dental X-ray. After being manually labeled for 9 different classes, these images were used for training. The deep neural network used in this study is You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 6, a one-step search method primarily used for real-time object detection. Three classes of dental diseases and six classes of differential treatments were identified with the aid of bounding boxes. Results show that this strategy was able to attain a mean average precision (mAP) of 70.76% by training with this smaller number of images, which shows tremendous potential for dentists and radiologists.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Early detection of tooth-related diseases in patients plays a key role in maintaining their dental health and preventing future complications. Since dentists are not overly attentive to tooth-related diseases that may be difficult to judge visually, many patients miss timely treatment. The 5 representative tooth-related diseases, that is, coronal caries or defect, proximal caries, cervical caries or abrasion, periapical radiolucency, and residual root can be detected on panoramic images. In this study, a web service was constructed for the detection of these diseases on panoramic images in real time, which helped shorten the treatment planning time and reduce the probability of misdiagnosis. Objective: This study designed a model to assess tooth-related diseases in panoramic images by using artificial intelligence in real time. This model can perform an auxiliary role in the diagnosis of tooth-related diseases by dentists and reduce the treatment planning time spent through telemedicine. Methods: For learning the 5 tooth-related diseases, 10,000 panoramic images were modeled: 4206 coronal caries or defects, 4478 proximal caries, 6920 cervical caries or abrasion, 8290 periapical radiolucencies, and 1446 residual roots. To learn the model, the fast region-based convolutional network (Fast R-CNN), residual neural network (ResNet), and inception models were used. Learning about the 5 tooth-related diseases completely did not provide accurate information on the diseases because of indistinct features present in the panoramic pictures. Therefore, 1 detection model was applied to each tooth-related disease, and the models for each of the diseases were integrated to increase accuracy. Results: The Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy, with an accuracy of over 90%, in diagnosing the 5 tooth-related diseases. Thus, Fast R-CNN was selected as the final judgment model as it facilitated the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases that are difficult to judge visually from radiographs and images, thereby assisting the dentists in their treatment plans. Conclusions: The Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy in the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases and can therefore play an auxiliary role in shortening the treatment planning time after the dentists diagnose the tooth-related disease. In addition, by updating the captured panoramic images of patients on the web service developed in this study, we are looking forward to increasing the accuracy of diagnosing these 5 tooth-related diseases. The dental diagnosis system in this study takes 2 minutes for diagnosing 5 diseases in 1 panoramic image. Therefore, this system plays an effective role in setting a dental treatment schedule. © 2022 by the Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To collect evidence on the ability of artificial intelligence programs to accurately make extraction decisions in orthodontic treatment planning. Data sources: Authors electronically searched the following databases: PubMed/ MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, LIVIVO, Computers & Applied Science, ACM Digital Library, and Compendex, Open Grey, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis. Study selection: Three independent reviewers collected the following data: number of cases of extraction and non-extraction, number of experts in orthodontics and their years of experience, number of variables used in the index model test, type of artificial intelligence and algorithms, accuracy outcomes, the three highest variable ranks weighted in the computational model, and the main conclusion. Data extraction and synthesis: Risk of bias was assessed using Quadas 2 checklist for AI, and certainty of evidence was evaluated by GRADE. Results: After 2 phases of screening by 3 independent reviewers, 6 studies met the inclusion criteria for the final review. The AI programs used by the included studies were as follows: ensemble learning/random forest, artificial neural network/multilayer perceptron, machine learning/back propagation and machine learning/feature vectors. All studies showed an unclear risk of bias for patient selection. Two studies had high risk of bias in the index test, while two others presented an unclear risk of bias in the diagnostic test. Meta-analysis of the pooled data resulted in 0.87 accuracy value for all studies. Conclusions: The authors conclude that AI’s ability to predict extractions is promising but should be interpreted with caution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to British Dental Association.

AB  - In the digital dentistry era, new tools, algorithms, data science approaches, and computer applications are available to researchers and clinicians. However, there is also a strong need for better knowledge and understanding of multisource data applications, including three-dimensional imaging information such as cone-beam computed tomography images and digital dental models for multidisciplinary cases. In addition, artificial intelligence models and automated clinical decision systems are rising. The clinician needs to plan the treatment based on state-of-the-art diagnosis for better and more personalized treatment. This article aimed to review basic concepts and the current panorama of digital implant planning in orthodontics, with open-source and closed-source tools for assessing cone-beam computed images and digital dental models. The visualization and processing of the three-dimensional data allow better implant planning based on bone conditions, adjacent teeth and root positions, and the prognosis of the case. We showed that many tools for assessment, segmentation, and visualization of cone-beam computed tomographic images and digital dental models could facilitate the treatment planning of patients needing implants or space closure. The tools and approaches presented are toward personalized treatment and better prognosis, following the path to a more automated clinical decision system based on multisource three-dimensional data, artificial intelligence models, and digital planning. In summary, the orthodontist needs to analyze each patient individually and use different software or tools that better fit their practice, allowing efficient treatment planning and satisfactory results with an adequate prognosis. © 2022 World Federation of Orthodontists

AB  - Objective: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw is preceded by dental extractions in up to 10% of cases. We present a case series of post-radiotherapy patients undergoing dental extractions who have received the prophylactic antifibrotic agents pentoxifylline and vitamin E (PVe) to prevent ORN. Study Design: A retrospective review was conducted of 219 patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing 1079 dental extractions between 2009 and 2020. Data regarding oncological treatment, prophylactic drug regimen, dental history, and clinical outcome was collected. Results: Twelve patients developed ORN at 17 extraction sites (ORN rates, 1.6% and 5.5% at tooth level and patient level, respectively). PVe regimen compliance significantly decreased ORN rates at the patient level (3.4% vs 11.5%; P < .03) and the tooth level (1.0% vs 3.5%; P < .01) compared with no PVe. Regimen compliance significantly reduced ORN rates in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (P < .01); in those with mandibular (P < .005) molar (P < .003), and flapless extractions (P < .04); in patients with radiation regions >40 Gy (P < .0009); and in those who underwent primary closure (P < .03). Machine learning analysis identified almost all these factors as influential at a tooth level for ORN. Conclusions: PVe regimen compliance decreased dental extraction ORN rates more than the literature base rates of 7% at the patient level and 2% at the tooth level. Given its success in managing existing ORN, PVe could be extended prophylactically for dental extractions in irradiated patients with head and neck cancer. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim and background: Artificial intelligence (AI) since it was introduced into dentistry, has become an important and valuable tool in many fields. It was applied in different specialties with different uses, for example, in diagnosis of oral cancer, periodontal disease and dental caries, and in the treatment planning and predicting the outcome of orthognathic surgeries. The aim of this comprehensive review is to report on the application and performance of AI models designed for application in the field of endodontics. Materials and methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to collect the most relevant articles using terms, such as AI, endodontics, and dentistry. This review included 56 papers related to AI and its application in endodontics. Result: The applications of AI were in detecting and diagnosing periapical lesions, assessing root fractures, working length determination, prediction for postoperative pain, studying root canal anatomy and decision-making in endodontics for retreatment. The accuracy of AI in performing these tasks can reach up to 90%. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence has valuable applications in the field of modern endodontics with promising results. Larger and multicenter data sets can give external validity to the AI models. Clinical significance: In the field of dentistry, AI models are specifically crafted to contribute to the diagnosis of oral diseases, ranging from common issues such as dental caries to more complex conditions like periodontal diseases and oral cancer. AI models can help in diagnosis, treatment planning, and in patient management in endodontics. Along with the modern tools like cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), AI can be a valuable aid to the clinician. © 2023, The Author(s). Open Access.

AB  - The process of constructing precise geometry of human jaws from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is crucial for building finite element models and treatment planning. Despite the success of deep learning techniques, they struggle to accurately identify delicate features such as thin structures and gaps between the tooth-bone interfaces where periodontal ligament resides, especially when trained on limited data. Therefore, segmented geometries obtained through automated methods still require extensive manual adjustment to achieve a smooth and organic 3D geometry that is suitable for simulations. In this work, we require the model to provide anatomically correct segmentation of teeth and bones which preserves the space for the periodontal ligament layers. To accomplish the task with few accurate labels, we pre-train a modified MultiPlanar UNet as the backbone model using inferior segmentations, i.e., tooth-bone segmentation with no space in the tooth-bone interfaces, and fine-tune the model with a dedicated loss function over accurate delineations that considers the space. We demonstrate that our approach can produce proper tooth-bone segmentations with gap interfaces that are fit for simulations when applied to human jaw CBCT scans. Furthermore, we propose a marker-based watershed segmentation applied on the MultiPlanar UNet probability map to separate individual tooth. This has advantages when the segmentation task is challenged by common artifacts caused by restorative materials or similar intensities in the teeth-teeth interfaces in occurrence of crowded teeth phenomenon.

AB  - Objective: Successful application of deep machine learning could reduce time-consuming and labor-intensive clinical work of calculating the amount of radiographic bone loss (RBL) in diagnosing and treatment planning for periodontitis. This study aimed to test the accuracy of RBL classification by machine learning. Materials and methods: A total of 236 patients with standardized full mouth radiographs were included. Each tooth from the periapical films was evaluated by three calibrated periodontists for categorization of RBL and radiographic defect morphology. Each image was pre-processed and augmented to ensure proper data balancing without data pollution, then a novel multitasking InceptionV3 model was applied. Results: The model demonstrated an average accuracy of 0.87 ± 0.01 in the categorization of mild (< 15%) or severe (≥ 15%) bone loss with fivefold cross-validation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of the model were 0.86 ± 0.03, 0.88 ± 0.03, 0.88 ± 0.03, and 0.86 ± 0.02, respectively. Conclusions: Application of deep machine learning for the detection of alveolar bone loss yielded promising results in this study. Additional data would be beneficial to enhance model construction and enable better machine learning performance for clinical implementation. Clinical relevance: Higher accuracy of radiographic bone loss classification by machine learning can be achieved with more clinical data and proper model construction for valuable clinical application. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Orthodontics is a specialized dental profession that specializes in diagnosing, preventing, and correcting teeth and jawbone, as well as biting patterns. The irregular shape of the teeth and jaws is very common. About 50% of the population of the developed world, according to the American Association of Orthodontics, has malocclusions heavy enough to benefit from orthopedic treatment. Cephalometries is often used by dentists as a tool for diagnosis and treatment planning and evaluation. Cephalometries aids in orthodontic diagnostics by empowering the study of skeletal structures, teeth, and soft tissues of the craniofacial region. Cephalometric analysis has many applications, including diagnostics, the definition of face measurement patterns, planning of orthodontic and orthognathic treatments, monitoring changes due to ageing or treatment and prediction of orthodontic and orthognathic treatment outcomes. Machine-based software is the only solution to reduce the dentist's work of planning and evaluation. Although some software are available for cephalometric analysis but, they are expensive and not easy to use as it requires heavy hardware-based tools such as laser guns and cephalostats. The proposed model uses a decision tree to develop a diagnostic program based on the data of previous patients assigned to it. This model is implemented using python language libraries such as Tkinter, Opencv, Sklearn, PIL and Pandas. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Aim: This scoping review aimed to compile and evaluate clinical trials investigating digital applications in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning by assessing their clinical relevance and future potential. Methods: Following the PCC-framework for scoping reviews and combining the source of analysis (Population/P: “prosthodontics”), the technique of interest (Concept/C: “digital application”) and the field of interest (Context/C: “diagnostics”), a three-pronged search strategy was applied in the database PubMed and Web of Science. Clinical trials (≥10 study participants, English/German) were considered until 2023-03-09. Reporting adhered to the PRISMA-ScR statement. Results: The search identified 520 titles, of which 18 full-texts met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. The trials involved a total of 14,457 study participants and were mapped for prosthetic subdisciplines: fixed (n = 9; 50%) and removable (n = 4; 22%) prosthodontics, reconstructive dentistry in general (n = 3; 17%), and temporo-mandibular joint disorders (n = 2; 11%). Data merging of medical format files, as DICOM+STL, was the dominant digital application (n = 7; 39%); and virtual treatment simulation using digital smile design or digital wax-up represented the most frequent prosthetic diagnostics (n = 6; 33%). Conclusion: This scoping review identified a relatively low number of clinical trials. The future potential of digital diagnostics appears to be mostly related to the subdiscipline of fixed prosthodontics, especially regarding virtual treatment simulation for communication with the patient and among dental professionals. Artificial intelligence emerged as a key technology in many of the identified studies. Further research in this area is needed to explore the capabilities of digital technologies in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) survivors treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) commonly show several pathological issues, including poor oral health, bone health impairment, and vitamin D deficiency. However, to date, oral health issues in BC survivors treated with AIs have been poorly investigated and their relationship with vitamin D deficiency are far from being understood. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between oral health and vitamin D status in BC survivors undergoing treatment with AIs through a machine learning approach. In this cross-sectional study, we included post-menopausal BC women with vitamin D deficiency undergoing AIs therapy. The outcome measures were the following: oral health indexes as the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Permanent Teeth Index (DMFT); serum levels of 25(OH)D3; Bone Mineral Density (BMD); and the diagnosis of osteoporosis. We included 41 post-menopausal BC women, mean aged 66.10 ± 8.47 years, with mean serum levels of vitamin D of 14.63 ± 6.62 ng/mL. Furthermore, 56.10% of patients had a diagnosis of osteoporosis and 36.59% were osteopenic. DMFT was significantly related to smoking (p-value = 0.005) and dental floss use (p-value = 0.001). There was a significant correlation between DMFT and vitamin D levels (Pearson’s r: −0.73; p-value = 0.001). The regression machine learning model showed that vitamin D status and the use of dental floss were the most relevant variables in terms of correlation with DMFT. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency, inadequate use of dental floss, and smoking had a negative impact on oral health in BC women. Thus, vitamin D deficiency screening and supplementation and a prompt oral rehabilitation plan should be suggested and implemented in the complex treatment framework of BC survivors undergoing treatment with AIs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Age estimation can aid in forensic medicine applications, diagnosis, and treatment planning for orthodontics and pediatrics. Existing dental age estimation methods rely heavily on specialized knowledge and are highly subjective, wasting time, and energy, which can be perfectly solved by machine learning techniques. As the key factor affecting the performance of machine learning models, there are usually two methods for feature extraction: human interference and autonomous extraction without human interference. However, previous studies have rarely applied these two methods for feature extraction in the same image analysis task. Herein, we present two types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dental age estimation. One is an automated dental stage evaluation model (ADSE model) based on specified manually defined features, and the other is an automated end-to-end dental age estimation model (ADAE model), which autonomously extracts potential features for dental age estimation. Although the mean absolute error (MAE) of the ADSE model for stage classification is 0.17 stages, its accuracy in dental age estimation is unsatisfactory, with the MAE (1.63 years) being only 0.04 years lower than the manual dental age estimation method (MDAE model). However, the MAE of the ADAE model is 0.83 years, being reduced by half that of the MDAE model. The results show that fully automated feature extraction in a deep learning model without human interference performs better in dental age estimation, prominently increasing the accuracy and objectivity. This indicates that without human interference, machine learning may perform better in the application of medical imaging. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aim: To develop a deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for instance segmentation and tooth numbering on orthopantomograms (OPGs). Materials and methods: Forty OPGs were manually annotated to lay down the ground truth for training two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): U-net and Faster RCNN. These algorithms were concurrently trained and validated on a dataset of 1280 teeth (40 OPGs) each. The U-net algorithm was trained on OPGs specifically annotated with polygons to label all 32 teeth via instance segmentation, allowing each tooth to be denoted as a separate entity from the surrounding structures. Simultaneously, teeth were also numbered according to the Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI) numbering system, using bounding boxes to train Faster RCNN. Consequently, both trained CNNs were combined to develop an AI model capable of segmenting and numbering all teeth on an OPG. Results: The performance of the U-net algorithm was determined using various performance metrics including precision = 88.8%, accuracy = 88.2%, recall = 87.3%, F-1 score = 88%, dice index = 92.3%, and Intersection over Union (IoU) = 86.3%. The performance metrics of the Faster RCNN algorithm were determined using overlap accuracy = 30.2 bounding boxes (out of a possible of 32 boxes) and classifier accuracy of labels = 93.8%. Conclusions: The instance segmentation and tooth numbering results of our trained AI model were close to the ground truth, indicating a promising future for their incorporation into clinical dental practice. The ability of an AI model to automatically identify teeth on OPGs will aid dentists with diagnosis and treatment planning, thus increasing efficiency © (2023), (Quintessenz Verlags-GmbH).

AB  - Background: Taking facial and intraoral clinical photos is one of the essential parts of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Among the diagnostic procedures, classification of the shuffled clinical photos with their orientations will be the initial step while it was not easy for a machine to classify photos with a variety of facial and dental situations. This article presents a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) deep learning technique to classify orthodontic clinical photos according to their orientations. Methods: To build an automated classification system, CNNs models of facial and intraoral categories were constructed, and the clinical photos that are routinely taken for orthodontic diagnosis were used to train the models with data augmentation. Prediction procedures were evaluated with separate photos whose purpose was only for prediction. Results: Overall, a 98.0% valid prediction rate resulted for both facial and intraoral photo classification. The highest prediction rate was 100% for facial lateral profile, intraoral upper, and lower photos. Conclusion: An artificial intelligence system that utilizes deep learning with proper training models can successfully classify orthodontic facial and intraoral photos automatically. This technique can be used for the first step of a fully automated orthodontic diagnostic system in the future. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In the current scenario, the evolution of orthodontics and dental based applications have been raised with a strong impact of Artificial Intelligence. The main objective of the proposed systematic review is to study the various applications and importance of AI in orthodontic treatment planning. Electronic databases like Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane, Medline, and Web of Science have been thoroughly searched. Included were studies that employed AI to plan orthodontic treatments. Data were retrieved and examined to determine the clinical significance of applying AI to orthodontic treatment planning. This PRISMA model-based systematic review includes a total of 73 papers. The investigations demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) may be applied in orthodontics for evaluation and importance of ML and AI in Orthodontic Treatment Planning, AI-based software can provide accurate and efficient analysis of cephalometric images, reducing the time and effort required for manual analysis. AI-Enabled cephalometric landmark detection for orthodontic analysis and treatment planning, investigating the application of artificial intelligence on the dentofacial orthopedics and the specialty of orthodontics, application of automated orthodontic extraction indication detection using AI, investigating the application of artificial intelligence on maxillofacial radiology and specialty of oral diagnostics, investigating the importance of artificial intelligence in therapeutic dentistry, AI-powered prediction of post-orthognathic surgery facial aesthetics, investigating the major application of artificial intelligence on the forensic odontology, investigating the major application of artificial intelligence on the maxillofacial surgery and specialty in oral. The systematic evaluation shows that AI provides promising potential for enhancing orthodontic treatment planning. The use of AI can result in more precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and individualized orthodontic care, all of which can improve clinical outcomes and satisfaction among patients. AI-based software for cephalometric analysis: Cephalometric analysis is a crucial step in orthodontic treatment planning. Predictive modeling: AI can predict the outcomes of orthodontic treatment by analyzing patient data and simulating treatment scenarios. This can help orthodontists in decision-making and inform patients about the expected outcomes of treatment. Patient monitoring: AI tools can monitor patient progress during treatment, enabling orthodontists to make real-time adjustments to the treatment plan. This can improve treatment outcomes and reduce the need for frequent in-person visits. Improved patient experience: AI-based tools can improve the patient experience by reducing treatment time, minimizing discomfort, and providing personalized treatment plans. Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize the field of orthodontics by improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. However, more research is needed to fully explore the potential of AI in orthodontic treatment planning and ensure its safe and effective implementation in clinical practice. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.

AB  - Aim. This comprehensive review is aimed at evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of artificial intelligence in endodontic dentistry. Introduction. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new technology that has widespread use in dentistry. The AI technologies have primarily been used in dentistry to diagnose dental diseases, plan treatment, make clinical decisions, and predict the prognosis. AI models like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been used in endodontics to study root canal system anatomy, determine working length measurements, detect periapical lesions and root fractures, predict the success of retreatment procedures, and predict the viability of dental pulp stem cells. Methodology. The literature was searched in electronic databases such as Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, published over the last four decades (January 1980 to September 15, 2021) by using keywords such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, application, endodontics, and dentistry. Results. The preliminary search yielded 2560 articles relevant enough to the paper's purpose. A total of 88 articles met the eligibility criteria. The majority of research on AI application in endodontics has concentrated on tracing apical foramen, verifying the working length, projection of periapical pathologies, root morphologies, and retreatment predictions and discovering the vertical root fractures. Conclusion. In endodontics, AI displayed accuracy in terms of diagnostic and prognostic evaluations. The use of AI can help enhance the treatment plan, which in turn can lead to an increase in the success rate of endodontic treatment outcomes. The AI is used extensively in endodontics and could help in clinical applications, such as detecting root fractures, periapical pathologies, determining working length, tracing apical foramen, the morphology of root, and disease prediction.  © 2023 Mohmed Isaqali Karobari et al.

AB  - Objectives: Automatically detecting dental conditions using Artificial intelligence (AI) and reporting it visually are now a need for treatment planning and dental health management. This work presents a comprehensive computer-aided detection system to detect dental restorations. Methods: The state-of-artten different deep-learning detection models were used including R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and RetinaNet as detectors. ResNet-50,ResNet-101, XCeption-101, VGG16, and DarkNet53 were integrated as backbone and feature extractor in addition to efficient approaches such Side-Aware Boundary Localization, cascaded structures and simple model frameworks like Libra and Dynamic. Total 684 objects in panoramic radiographs were used to detect available three classes, namely, dental restorations, denture and implant. Each model was evaluated by mean average precision (mAP), average recall (AR), and precision-recall curve using Common Objects in Context (COCO) detection evaluation metrics. Results: mAP varied between 0.755 and 0.973 for ten models explored while AR ranges between 0.605 and 0.771. Faster R-CNN RegnetX provided the best detection performance with mAP of 0.973 and AR of 0.771. Area under precision-recall curve was 0.952. Precision-recall curve indicated that errors were mainly dominated by localization confusions. Conclusions: Results showed that the proposed AI-based computer-aided system had great potential with reliable, accurate performance detecting dental restorations, denture and implant in panoramic radiographs. As training models with more data and standardization in reporting, AI-based solutions will be implemented to dental clinics for daily use soon.  © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: A case report is presented to demonstrate advantages of a new fully digital approach, from planning through to execution to immediate loading implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. Until now, the function of the diagnostic wax-up has not been assessable and the functionalization of the finished product, be it either a provisional or a definitive, has been entrusted entirely to the ability of the technician. Case Description: A female patient, unaffected by systemic disease and cranio-cervico-mandibular muscular pain, required removal of hopeless residual teeth of the upper arch and substitution with immediately loaded implants using guided surgery. A fully digital technique was performed using specific software to record individual condylar (axiography) movements and mastication cycles and to correlate these with initial intra-oral scans in order to create a virtual 3D individual value articulator. Seven implants were placed using guided surgery and the prosthetic rehabilitation was successfully performed as planned. Conclusion: The use of guided surgery guarantees atraumaticity and procedure predictability as documented in recent literature. However, in this case, for the first time, using the digital axiograph and digital articulator, it was possible to record the axiography of condylar movements in order to 'functionalize' the diagnostic wax-up prior to its insertion into guided surgery software. This clinical case suggests how the software's compatibility with intra-oral scan files, diagnostic wax-up, facial scans, CBCT and, in the near future, electromyography of mastication muscles permits the clinician to work on a virtual patient and analyze all critical aesthetic and functional parameters prior to guided surgery. © 2022 Zingari et al.

AB  - Objective: Various health-related fields have applied Machine learning (ML) techniques such as text mining, topic modeling (TM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) to automate tasks otherwise completed by humans to enhance patient care. However, research in dentistry on the integration of these techniques into the clinic arena has yet to exist. Thus, the purpose of this study was to: introduce a method of automating the reviewing patient chart information using ML, provide a step-by-step description of how it was conducted, and demonstrate this method's potential to identify predictive relationships between patient chart information and important oral health-related contributors. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted to demonstrate the approach on a set of anonymized patient charts collected from a dental clinic. Two ML applications for patient chart review were demonstrated: (1) text mining and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were used to preprocess, model, and cluster data in a narrative format and extract common topics for further analysis, (2) Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) and ANN were used to determine predictive relationships between the extracted patient chart data topics and oral health-related contributors. All analysis was conducted in R and SPSS (IBM, SPSS, statistics 22). Results: Data from 785 patient charts were analyzed. Preprocessing of raw data (data cleaning and categorizing) identified 66 variables, of which 45 were included for analysis. Using LDA, 10 radiographic findings topics and 8 treatment planning topics were extracted from the data. OLR showed that caries risk, occlusal risk, biomechanical risk, gingival recession, periodontitis, gingivitis, assisted mouth opening, and muscle tenderness were highly predictable using the extracted radiographic and treatment planning topics and chart information. Using the statistically significant predictors obtained from OLR, ANN analysis showed that the model can correctly predict >72% of all variables except for bruxism and tooth crowding (63.1 and 68.9%, respectively). Conclusion: Our study presents a novel approach to address the need for data-enabled innovations in the field of dentistry and creates new areas of research in dental analytics. Utilizing ML methods and its application in dental practice has the potential to improve clinicians' and patients' understanding of the major factors that contribute to oral health diseases/conditions.

AB  - The detection of maxillary sinus wall is important in dental fields such as implant surgery, tooth extraction, and odontogenic disease diagnosis. The accurate segmentation of the maxillary sinus is required as a cornerstone for diagnosis and treatment planning. This study proposes a deep learning-based method for fully automatic segmentation of the maxillary sinus, including clear or hazy states, on cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images. A model for segmentation of the maxillary sinuses was developed using U-Net, a convolutional neural network, and a total of 19,350 CBCT images were used from 90 maxillary sinuses (34 clear sinuses, 56 hazy sinuses). Post-processing to eliminate prediction errors of the U-Net segmentation results increased the accuracy. The average prediction results of U-Net were a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.9090 ± 0.1921 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.7013 ± 4.6154. After post-processing, the average results improved to a DSC of 0.9099 ± 0.1914 and an HD of 2.1470 ± 2.2790. The proposed deep learning model with post-processing showed good performance for clear and hazy maxillary sinus segmentation. This model has the potential to help dental clinicians with maxillary sinus segmentation, yielding equivalent accuracy in a variety of cases. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Lateral cephalograms provide important information regarding dental, skeletal, and soft-tissue parameters that are critical for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Several machine learning methods have previously been used for the automated localization of diagnostically relevant landmarks on lateral cephalograms. In this study, we applied an ensemble of regression trees to solve this problem. We found that despite the limited size of manually labeled images, we can improve the performance of landmark detection by augmenting the training set using a battery of simple image transforms. We further demonstrated the calculation of second-order features encoding the relative locations of landmarks, which are diagnostically more important than individual landmarks. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate tooth numbering is essential for dental procedures, treatment planning, and patient record management. Automatic tooth enumeration in dental panoramic radiographs is crucial in modern dental image analysis and diagnosis. Tooth enumeration in panoramic radiographs has relied on handcrafted features and traditional image processing techniques. Still, these methods often lack the accuracy and robustness required for complex cases and varied image qualities. Despite the advancements in deep learning-based object detection algorithms, a significant research gap remains in the specific domain of automatic tooth enumeration on panoramic radiographs. This research paper presents an innovative approach for automatic tooth enumeration on panoramic radiographs using the state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection framework focused on implementing the YOLOv5 library. The YOLOv5 model is evaluated as an efficient system capable of accurately detecting and enumerating individual teeth from panoramic radiographs. The 612 panoramic radiograph images evaluation shows the bounding-box results show the best tooth detection rate in the YOLOv5x model. The YOLOv5 model is generally very good at predicting tooth enumeration on panoramic radiographs in a relatively small dataset. This advancement is expected to enhance dental diagnosis and treatment planning, benefiting dental professionals and patients. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Teeth segmentation is an essential task in dental image analysis for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. While supervised deep learning methods can be utilized for teeth segmentation, they often require extensive manual annotation of segmentation masks, which is time-consuming and costly. In this research, we propose a weakly supervised approach for teeth segmentation that reduces the need for manual annotation. Our method utilizes the output heatmaps and intermediate feature maps from a keypoint detection network to guide the segmentation process. We introduce the TriDental dataset, consisting of 3000 oral cavity images annotated with teeth keypoints, to train a teeth keypoint detection network. We combine feature maps from different layers of the keypoint detection network, enabling accurate teeth segmentation without explicit segmentation annotations. The detected keypoints are also used for further refinement of the segmentation masks. Experimental results on the TriDental dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Our method offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for teeth segmentation in real-world dental applications, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotation efforts. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Three-dimensional digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) are one of the most recent and relevant advancements in the field of dentistry, including in orthodontics. These systems have enabled clinicians to increase the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment planning, to improve patient care along with reducing treatment planning time. The present study aims to explore possible applications of the artificial intelligence (AI) to examine the upper airway and to assess the reliability of the automatic evaluation of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Thirty CBCTs, with the field of view 15*15, were uploaded to the Diagnocat (LLC Diagnocat, Moscow, Russia) account, and the radiologic orthodontic report of each was generated as the basis of automatic evaluation. The same CBCTs were manually evaluated by independent evaluator. 3D color visualization of upper airway, total and minimum volume, UPW, LPW, PASmin and A/N ratio were assessed. The data were collected to allow statistical analysis with Microsoft Excel software. A total of 60 reports were created for 30 CBCTs. Reliability the correspondence between the two methods was 93.3%. A positive correlation between the minimum sagittal linear dimension (MSLD) on 2-dimensional reconstructed lateral cephalograms and minimum cross-sectional area (MCSA) on the CBCTs and a negative correlation between A/N ratio and total area airway were established. The AI system can be helpful as an initial evaluation of upper airway screening CBCTs, giving appropriate credibility reports and suggesting additional diagnostic methods for more accurate evaluation if needed. The AI technology can also help improve the accuracy of diagnoses for orthodontic treatment, therefore, helping orthodontists work more efficiently. However, the AI has shortcomings in assessing adenoid hypertrophy (AH). In conclusion, the fields of artificial intelligence in orthodontic diagnostics can be useful for upper airway screening and also have great priorities. Research in the field of upper airway diagnostics using artificial intelligence requires further studies. © 2023, Journal of International Dental and Medical Research. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders affecting amelogenesis during dental development. Therefore, the molecular genetic etiology of AI can provide information about the nature and progress of the disease. To confirm the genetic etiology of AI in a Korean family with an autosomal dominant inheritance, pedigree and mutational analyses were performed. DNA was isolated from the participating family members and whole-exome sequencing was performed with the DNA sample of the father of the proband. The identified mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The mutational analysis revealed a novel nonsense mutation in the FAM83H gene (NM_198488.5: c.1363C > T, p.(Gln455*)), confirming autosomal dominant hypocalcified AI. Full-mouth restorative treatments of the affected children were performed after the completion of the deciduous dentition. Early diagnosis of AI can be useful for understanding the nature of the disease and for managing the condition and treatment planning. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Emerging technologies powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked hope of achieving better clinical outcomes among patients. One of the trends is the use of medical image recognition systems to screen, diagnose, or stratify risks of diseases. This technology may enhance sensitivity and specificity and thus, improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis. Therefore, it is important and beneficial for healthcare providers to understand the basic concepts of AI so that they can develop and provide their own AI-powered technology. The purpose of this literature review is to provide (1) a simplified introduction to AI, (2) a brief review of studies on medical image recognition systems powered by AI, and (3) discuss some challenging aspects in this field. While there are various AI-powered medical image recognition systems, this paper mainly discusses those integrated in smartphone apps. Medical fields that have implemented image recognition models in smartphones include dermatology, ophthalmology, nutrition, neurology, respiratology, hematology, gynecology, and dentistry. Albeit promising, AI technology may raise challenges from the technical and social aspects of its application. Notable technical issues are limited dataset access and small datasets, especially for rare diseases. In a social context, the perspectives of all involved parties (physicians, patients, and engineers) must be considered. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision medicine (previously referred to as personalized medicine) as "an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle." Advances in precision medicine presage similar progress in dentistry and will be increasingly harnessed to improve dental care. This article discusses some of the ongoing and projected developments in health information technology, clinical diagnosis frameworks, biomedicine and biotechnology and highlights their current and future applications in precision dentistry. Innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, high-throughput sequencing and other molecular techniques (e.g., genomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and transcriptomics) may be fully incorporated into the clinic within the next few decades. Nevertheless, it is imperative to understand that while technology usage can enhance the rate at which clinical success can be achieved, it does not equate to or guarantee clinical success. As dentistry transitions toward a data-augmented model that customizes treatment options, including preventive care, precision dentistry will continue to benefit from advances in many fields to improve health care delivery and clinical outcomes. © 2022 California Dental Association.

AB  - Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a popular imaging modality in dentistry for diagnosing and planning treatment for a variety of oral diseases with the ability to produce detailed, three-dimensional images of the teeth, jawbones, and surrounding structures. CBCT imaging has emerged as an essential diagnostic tool in dentistry. CBCT imaging has seen significant improvements in terms of its diagnostic value, as well as its accuracy and efficiency, with the most recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper reviews recent AI trends and practices in dental CBCT imaging. AI has been used for lesion detection, malocclusion classification, measurement of buccal bone thickness, and classification and segmentation of teeth, alveolar bones, mandibles, landmarks, contours, and pharyngeal airways using CBCT images. Mainly machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and super-resolution techniques are used for these tasks. This review focuses on the potential of AI techniques to transform CBCT imaging in dentistry, which would improve both diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of artificial intelligence in dentistry and CBCT imaging.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the tissues surrounding the tooth that results in loss of periodontal attachment detected as clinical attachment loss (CAL). The mildest form of periodontal disease is gingivitis, which is a necessary condition for periodontitis development. We can distinguish also some modifying factors which have an influence on the rate of development of periodontitis from which the most important are smoking and poorly controlled diabetes. According to the new classification from 2017, we can identify four stages of periodontitis and three grades of periodontitis. Grades tell us about the periodontitis progression risk and may be helpful in treatment planning and motivating the patients. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used in medicine and in dentistry as an additional tool to support clinicians in their work. In this paper, ANN was used to assess grades of periodontitis in the group of patients. Gender, age, nicotinism approximal plaque index (API), bleeding on probing (BoP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and pocket depth (PD) were taken into consideration. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical periodontal assessment in relation to the neural network assessment. Based on the definition of the sensitivity and specificity in medicine we obtained 85.7% and 80.0% as a correctly diagnosed and excluded disease, respectively. The quality of the neural network, defined as the percentage of correctly classified patients according to the grade of periodontitis was 84.2% for the training set. The percentage of incorrectly classified patients according to the grade of periodontitis was 15.8%. Artificial neural networks may be useful tool in everyday dental practice to assess the risk of periodontitis development however more studies are needed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. To date, a limited number of studies have examined the impact of this pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors of older populations. This longitudinal study examined personal characteristics linked to COVID-19 outcomes as predictors of self-reported delayed healthcare services attributed to this pandemic, among U.S. adults, ≥50 years of age. Methods: Secondary analyses were performed using cross-sectional data (1413 participants) and longitudinal data (2881 participants) from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (2006–2018) linked to the 2020 HRS COVID-19 Project (57% female, mean age: 68 years). Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health characteristics were evaluated in relation to delayed overall, surgical and non-surgical healthcare services (“Since March 2020, was there any time when you needed medical or dental care, but delayed getting it, or did not get it at all?” and “What type of care did you delay”) using logistic regression and Ensemble machine learning for cross-sectional data as well as mixed-effects logistic modeling for longitudinal data. Results: Nearly 32.7% delayed healthcare services, 5.8% delayed surgical services and 31.4% delayed non-surgical services. Being female, having a college degree or higher and 1-unit increase in depression score were key predictors of delayed healthcare services. In fully adjusted logistic models, a history of 1 or 2 cardiovascular and/or metabolic conditions (vs. none) was associated with 60–70% greater odds of delays in non-surgical services, with distinct findings for histories of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. Ensemble machine learning predicted surgical better than overall and non-surgical healthcare delays. Conclusion: Among older adults, sex, education and depressive symptoms are key predictors of delayed healthcare services attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Delays in surgical and non-surgical healthcare services may have distinct predictors, with non-surgical delays more frequently observed among individuals with a history of 1 or 2 cardiovascular and/or metabolic conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The study paper showcases a detailed study of dental imaging can be possible only under the technology of open-source image processing modules as it involves the use of the latest image processing tools and devices for improving both the quality and accuracy of dental images. Dental radiography delivers significant indications for medical diagnosis, treatment and superiority valuation. Many determinations have been prepared to mature numeral X-ray image investigation organizations to progress medical eminence. This paper has presented records, techniques, and consequences for assessing the superiority of dental caution-consuming circumferential dental radiographs occupied earlier and afterwards the technique. Dental experimental eminence assessment comprises many procedures, such as statistics of yearly dental appointments of kids and grownups of dissimilar eternities, different caries between kids with vigorous caries, endodontics to abstraction events etc. This eminence extent evaluates dental scientific superiority. At the macro level, It is needed to escalate the micro level equally well, such as thoughtful whether the treatment assumed to distinct teeth is operative or not. The original and developing ground in orthodonture is dental informatics, owing to its possibility to recover treatment and analysis, while exchangeable time and plummeting nervousness and exhaustion throughout the regular repetition. The usage of computer curriculums can comfort dental specialists in the creation of conclusions associated with deterrence, identification, as well as cure schedule, surrounded by others. This study paper will also discuss the efficiency of Image processing tools that help a dentist and dental professionals improve the treatment quality. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Technology-enhanced simulations seem to be effective in dentistry, as they can support dental students to improve competencies in simulated environments. However, implementation of this technology in orthodontic education has not been reviewed. Objective: This scoping review aimed to comprehensively summarize the use of technology-enhanced simulations in orthodontic practice. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify literature on technology-enhanced simulation-based learning in orthodontic education published from 2000 to 2021. The search was conducted up to September 2021 to identify articles from Scopus, Embase, PubMed, Pro- Quest Dissertations & Theses Global, Google Scholar and the reference lists of identified articles. Results: The search identified 177 articles. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 articles of 14 digital simulators were included in this review. The findings demonstrated an increasing use of technology-enhanced simulations in orthodontic education. They were designed in several formats, including three-dimensional virtual format, augmented reality, virtual reality, automaton, haptic, and scenario-based simulations. These simulations were implemented in varied areas of orthodontics including diagnosis and treatment planning, bracket positioning, orthodontic procedures, facial landmark, removable appliance and cephalometric tracing. Most included articles demonstrated the development process without outcome evaluation. Six studies provided outcome evaluations at reaction or learning levels. None of them provide the evaluation at behaviour and results levels. Conclusion: Insufficient evidence has been generated to demonstrate the effectiveness of technology-enhanced simulations in orthodontic education. However, high-fidelity computer-based simulations together with robust design research should be required to confirm educational impact in orthodontic education. © 2023, Dental Press International.

AB  - Panoramic radiographs are an integral part of effective dental treatment planning, supporting dentists in identifying impacted teeth, infections, malignancies, and other dental issues. However, screening for anomalies solely based on a dentist's assessment may result in diagnostic inconsistency, posing difficulties in developing a successful treatment plan. Recent advancements in deep learning-based segmentation and object detection algorithms have enabled the provision of predictable and practical identification to assist in the evaluation of a patient's mineralized oral health, enabling dentists to construct a more successful treatment plan. However, there has been a lack of efforts to develop collaborative models that enhance learning performance by leveraging individual models. The article describes a novel technique for enabling collaborative learning by incorporating tooth segmentation and identification models created independently from panoramic radiographs. This collaborative technique permits the aggregation of tooth segmentation and identification to produce enhanced results by recognizing and numbering existing teeth (up to 32 teeth). The experimental findings indicate that the proposed collaborative model is significantly more effective than individual learning models (e.g., 98.77% vs. 96% and 98.44% vs.91% for tooth segmentation and recognition, respectively). Additionally, our models outperform the state-of-the-art segmentation and identification research. We demonstrated the effectiveness of collaborative learning in detecting and segmenting teeth in a variety of complex situations, including healthy dentition, missing teeth, orthodontic treatment in progress, and dentition with dental implants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to develop artificial intelligence (AI) guided framework to recognize tooth numbers in panoramic and intraoral radiographs (periapical and bitewing) without prior domain knowledge and arrange the intraoral radiographs into a full mouth series (FMS) arrangement template. This model can be integrated with different diseases diagnosis models, such as periodontitis or caries, to facilitate clinical examinations and diagnoses. Methods: The framework utilized image segmentation models to generate the masks of bone area, tooth, and cementoenamel junction (CEJ) lines from intraoral radiographs. These masks were used to detect and extract teeth bounding boxes utilizing several image analysis methods. Then, individual teeth were matched with a patient’s panoramic images (if available) or tooth repositories for assigning tooth numbers using the multi-scale matching strategy. This framework was tested on 1240 intraoral radiographs different from the training and internal validation cohort to avoid data snooping. Besides, a web interface was designed to generate a report for different dental abnormalities with tooth numbers to evaluate this framework’s practicality in clinical settings. Results: The proposed method achieved the following precision and recall via panoramic view: 0.96 and 0.96 (via panoramic view) and 0.87 and 0.87 (via repository match) by handling tooth shape variation and outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed framework could accurately arrange a set of intraoral radiographs into an FMS arrangement template based on positions and tooth numbers with an accuracy of 95% for periapical images and 90% for bitewing images. The accuracy of this framework was also 94% in the images with missing teeth and 89% with restorations. Conclusions: The proposed tooth numbering model is robust and self-contained and can also be integrated with other dental diagnosis modules, such as alveolar bone assessment and caries detection. This artificial intelligence-based tooth detection and tooth number assignment in dental radiographs will help dentists with enhanced communication, documentation, and treatment planning accurately. In addition, the proposed framework can correctly specify detailed diagnostic information associated with a single tooth without human intervention. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - While optical impression systems and CAD/CAM procedures have become routine in prosthodontic daily practice, thanks to the continuing evolution of technologies, new digital means are gaining in importance for prosthodontics and for dentistry in general. All of these technologies will have a pronounced influence on daily practice in the future, and it becomes more and more evident that the prosthodontics tomorrow will not be the same as it is practiced today. Oral health monitor ing will be done by the patient at home, supported by special software, and appointments with the general dentist or specialist will be made through software when needed. Patient case analysis and treatment planning will be at least supported, if not done, by software. The communication of treatment goals will also be supported by software and tested in parallel virtual “worlds” before treatment acceptance. Treatment execution may be performed fully automated by robots or at least supported in part, and, finally, monitoring will again be done by software as a support for the patients at home. Fewer visits in the dental office will be needed, treat ments will become more efficient and less expensive (in the best case—at least we hope so!), and office structures will have to be adapted. Hence, the professional lives of dentist and prosthodontists will ultimately change. © Copyright 2022, Quintessence Publishing Company, Ltd.

AB  - Root canal therapy is a vital dental procedure for salvaging severely decayed or infected teeth, preserving them instead of extracting them, thus averting the risk of reinfection. Nonetheless, the prevalence of root canal treatment (RCT) failure is surprisingly high, potentially leading to painful abscesses and severe infections. This study delves into the multifaceted reasons behind RCT failures and employs support vector machine (SVM) technology to predict treatment longevity. The research dataset comprises 332 manual instances, subjected to rigorous 10-fold cross-validation for testing and accuracy assessment. SVM is employed to categorize failed RCT cases into distinct classes, such as broken instruments, periapical radiolucency, root fractures, vertical root fractures, pulp stones, adequate periodontal support, periapical abscesses, overfilled cavities, and perforated or underfilled cavities. By scrutinizing the interplay between these treatment-failure-causing factors, the system discerns their impact on treatment duration. Comparisons are made with other machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR) and the naïve Bayes classifier (NB), to pinpoint the root causes of RCT failure in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Interestingly, logistic regression emerges as the top-performing model, with an impressive 92.47% accuracy rate. This study investigates the causes of RCT failure and employs SVM to predict treatment longevity, offering crucial insights for addressing this common dental issue. This study’s findings highlight the efficacy of logistic regression for identifying RCT failure causes, providing valuable guidance for improving dental procedures and patient outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - New digital technologies, like in other fields, have revolutionized the health care field and orthodontic practice in the 21st century. They can assist the health care professionals in working more efficiently by saving time and improving patient care. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and 3D printing technology are useful for improving diagnosis and treatment planning, creating algorithms and manufacturing customized orthodontic appliances. AI accomplishes the task of human beings with the help of machines and technology. In orthodontics, AI-based models have been used for diagnosis, treatment planning, clinical decision-making and prognosis prediction. It minimizes the required workforce and speeds up the diagnosis and treatment procedure. In addition, the 3D printing technology is used to fabricate study models, clear aligner models, surgical guides for inserting mini-implants, clear aligners, lingual appliances, wires components for removable appliances and occlusal splints.

AB  - In this intellectual work, the clinical and educational aspects of dentistry were confronted with practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt. However, there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal implications, and further consensus is needed for the safe and responsible implementation of AI in dental education. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Aim: This study was aimed to evaluate two artificial intelligence (AI) systems that created a prioritized problem list and treatment plan, and examine whether the performance of the aforementioned systems was equivalent to orthodontists. Materials and methods: A total of 967 consecutive cases [800: training; 67: validation; 100: evaluation (40: randomly selected for the clinical evaluation)] were used. We used a stored document that describes (1) the patient's clinical information, (2) the prioritized list, and (3) a treatment strategy without digital tooth movement. Sentences of (1) were vectorized according to the bag of words method (V); sentences of (2) and (3) were relabelled with 423 and 330 labels, respectively. AI systems that output labels for the prioritized list (subtask 1) and treatment planning (subtask 2) based on the vectors V were developed using a support vector machine and self-attention network, respectively, while the system was trained to improve precision and recall. Clinical evaluations were conducted by four orthodontists (no faculty or residents; peer group) in two sessions: in the first session, peer group and the developed AI systems created problem lists and treatment plans; in the second session, two of the peer group (not AI) evaluated these lists and plans, including the lists and plans of the AIs, by scoring them using 4-point scales [unacceptable (1) to ideal (4)]. Scores were compared among the system and peer group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.05). Results: The precision after system training was 65% and 48% for subtasks 1 and 2 respectively, with recall of 55% and 48%, respectively. The clinical evaluation of the AI system for subtask 1 showed a mid-rank. For subtask 2, the AI system had a significantly lower score than the three panels but the same rank with one panel. Conclusions: Two AI systems that output a prioritized problem list and create a treatment plan were developed. The clinical system ability of the former system showed a mid-rank in the peer group, and the latter system was almost equivalent to the worst orthodontist.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: Cephalometric analysis is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome assessment of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve automated landmark localization has proved feasible and convenient. However, current systems remain insufficient for clinical application, as patients exhibit various malocclusions in cephalograms produced by different manufacturers while limited cephalograms were applied to train AI in these systems. Methods: A robust and clinically applicable AI system was proposed for automatic cephalometric analysis. First, 9870 cephalograms taken by different radiography machines with various malocclusions of patients were collected from 20 medical institutions. Then 30 landmarks of all these cephalogram samples were manually annotated to train an AI system, composed of a two-stage convolutional neural network and a software-as-a-service system. Further, more than 100 orthodontists participated to refine the AI-output landmark localizations and retrain this system. Results: The average landmark prediction error of this system was as low as 0.94 ± 0.74 mm and the system achieved an average classification accuracy of 89.33%. Conclusions: An automatic cephalometric analysis system based on convolutional neural network was proposed, which can realize automatic landmark location and cephalometric measurements classification. This system showed promise in improving diagnostic efficiency in clinical circumstances. © 2023 British Institute of Radiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This narrative review aims to explore the current status of facial scanning technology in the dental field; outlining the history, mechanisms, and current evidence regarding its use and limitations within digital dentistry. Methods: Subtopics within facial scanner technology in dentistry were identified and divided among four reviewers. Electronic searches of the Medline (PubMed) database were performed with the following search terms: facial scanner, dentistry, prosthodontics, virtual patient, sleep apnea, maxillofacial prosthetics, accuracy. For this review only studies or review papers evaluating facial scanning technology for dental or medical applications were included. A total of 44 articles were included. Due to the narrative nature of this review, no formal evidence-based quality assessment was performed and the search was limited to the English language. No further restrictions were applied. Results: The significance, applications, limitations, and future directions of facial scanning technology were reviewed. Specific subtopics include significant history of facial scanner use and development for dentistry, different types and mechanisms used in facial scanning technology, accuracy of scanning technology, use as a diagnostic tool, use in creating a virtual patient, virtual articulation, smile design, diagnosing and treating obstructive sleep apnea, limitations of scanning technology, and future directions with artificial intelligence. Conclusions: Despite limitations in scan quality and software operation, 3D facial scanners are rapid and non-invasive tools that can be utilized in multiple facets of dental care. Facial scanners can serve an invaluable role in the digital workflow by capturing facial records to facilitate interdisciplinary communication, virtual articulation, smile design, and obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment. Looking into the future, facial scanning technology has promising applications in the fields of craniofacial research, and prosthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To qualitatively and quantitatively assess integrated segmentation of three convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the creation of a maxillary virtual patient (MVP) from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Materials and methods: A dataset of 40 CBCT scans acquired with different scanning parameters was selected. Three previously validated individual CNN models were integrated to achieve a combined segmentation of maxillary complex, maxillary sinuses, and upper dentition. Two experts performed a qualitative assessment, scoring-integrated segmentations from 0 to 10 based on the number of required refinements. Furthermore, experts executed refinements, allowing performance comparison between integrated automated segmentation (AS) and refined segmentation (RS) models. Inter-observer consistency of the refinements and the time needed to create a full-resolution automatic segmentation were calculated. Results: From the dataset, 85% scored 7–10, and 15% were within 3–6. The average time required for automated segmentation was 1.7 min. Performance metrics indicated an excellent overlap between automatic and refined segmentation with a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 99.3%. High inter-observer consistency of refinements was observed, with a 95% Hausdorff distance (HD) of 0.045 mm. Conclusion: The integrated CNN models proved to be fast, accurate, and consistent along with a strong interobserver consistency in creating the MVP. Clinical relevance: The automated segmentation of these structures simultaneously could act as a valuable tool in clinical orthodontics, implant rehabilitation, and any oral or maxillofacial surgical procedures, where visualization of MVP and its relationship with surrounding structures is a necessity for reaching an accurate diagnosis and patient-specific treatment planning. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence system based on deep learning for the segmentation of occlusal, proximal and cervical caries lesions on panoramic radiographs. The study included 504 anonymous panoramic radiographs obtained from the radiology archive of Inonu University Faculty of Dentistry’s Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology from January 2018 to January 2020. This study proposes Dental Caries Detection Network (DCDNet) architecture for dental caries segmentation. The main difference between DCDNet and other segmentation architecture is that the last part of DCDNet contains a Multi-Predicted Output (MPO) structure. In MPO, the final feature map split into three different paths for detecting occlusal, proximal and cervical caries. Extensive experimental analyses were executed to analyze the DCDNet network architecture performance. In these comparison results, while the proposed model achieved an average F1-score of 62.79%, the highest average F1-score of 15.69% was achieved with the state-of-the-art segmentation models. These results show that the proposed artificial intelligence-based model can be one of the indispensable auxiliary tools of dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of carious lesions by enabling their detection in different locations with high success. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The digital workflow process follows different steps for all dental specialties. However, the main ingredient for the diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up workflow recipes is the imaging chain. The steps in the imaging chain usually include all or at least some of the following modalities: cone-beam computed tomographic data acquisition, segmentation of the cone-beam computed tomography image, intra oral scanning, facial three-dimensional soft tissue capture and superimposition of all the images for the creation of a virtual augmented model. As a relevant clinical problem, the accumulation of error at each step of the chain might negatively influence the final outcome. For an efficient digital workflow, it is important to be aware of the existing challenges within the imaging chain. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based strategies need to be integrated in the future to make the workflow more simplified, accurate and efficient. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In dental medicine, the study of mandibular movement has an important role in oral rehabilitation as it allows diagnosis of pathologies in the temporomandibular joint and the definition of adequate treatment plans. In this paper, a new device specially developed for the acquisition and analysis of 3D mandibular movement is presented. A facial arc is adopted as its main support structure and electromagnetic sensors are employed to acquire the mandibular movement. A neural network is used to transform the electrical signals output by the sensors into 3D Cartesian coordinates. A custom-made computer application is developed to display and analyse the movement acquired. The device is shown to be easy to use, comfortable for patients and capable of being produced at an affordable price. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd.

AB  - The 3D data acquisition, reconstruction and accurate segmentation of teeth are of great significance for diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry. A 3D tooth model was reconstructed based on the cone-beam-CT (CBCT), and an improved GCNN network was proposed to improve the semantic segmentation of each tooth in the 3D tooth model. Accurate semantic segmentation of individual tooth can be achieved by deep learning of the fine local details as well as rough global structure of each tooth. The framework of the improved network consists of two parts: (1) an example segmentation network, which is used to obtain the general shape and relative position information of each tooth; (2) a fine-grained segmentation network, which is used to learn the fine details of individual tooth. A penalty mechanism for mis-assigned labels was further used to improve the accuracy of tooth segmentation. The results showed that the end-to-end deep learning framework used in this study can achieve accurate segmentation in the 3D tooth. The mean intersection over union (MIoU) score of the proposed improved GCNN network achieves 0.91, which was much better than that of PointNet ++ (MIoU: 0.78) and GACNet (MIoU: 0.88). © 2020, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

AB  - Rehabilitation of a patient with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) from both the functional and esthetic standpoints represents a challenge. The complexity of the condition requires an interdisciplinary approach for optimal treatment outcomes. A number of treatment options have been proposed. Recently, the use of bonded restorations has gained popularity because of the many benefits associated with these materials; excellent esthetics, conservative approach, and improved wear make their use advantageous. This article describes a direct approach with resin composite restorations for the transitional treatment of an adolescent with hypoplastic AI who had not completed skeletal growth. Protection against further wear, sensitivity, and plaque accumulation while significantly enhancing the patient's esthetic appearance made this case a success. Furthermore, this article describes the use of a "Clear matrix" technique, which considerably helped simplify the placement of the bonded restorations. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This article highlights (1) the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to the successful treatment planning of a patient with hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), and (2) the conservativeness and suitability of full coverage direct resin composite restorations for the transitional treatment of AI-affected teeth on an adolescent patient who has not yet completed skeletal growth. © 2009, WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

AB  - The authors developed and tested 12 neural networks of different architectures to make lower-third-molar treatment-planning decisions, using a software-based neural network (Neudesk 1.2, Neural Computer Sciences, Southampton, UK). Network training was undertaken using clinical histories from 119 patients (with 238 lower third molars) referred for treatment planning (79 females and 40 males, mean age 25 years) together with output data consisting of actual treatments planned by a senior oral surgeon. Both the input clinical data and the consultant decisions were treated on a tooth-wise basis and were coded to numerical values. Binary data (e.g., present/absent) were coded to 1 and 0, while quantitative data (e.g., age) were scaled to fall between 0 and 1. A network based on the optimal architecture was trained and then interrogated with test data derived from a further 174 patients (119 females and 55 males, mean age 26 years) with 348 lower third molars. Network decisions were dichotomized with a threshold of 0.8. With no knowledge of the network decisions, the senior oral surgeon indicated his preferred treatments. The teeth were then assigned to "gold-standard" categories of indications present or absent based on National Institutes of Health consensus criteria. Against this, the network achieved a sensitivity of 0.78, which was slightly inferior to that of the oral surgeon (0.88), although this difference was not significant, and a specificity of 0.98, compared with 0.99 for the oral surgeon (p = NS). Agreement between the oral surgeon and network decisions was very high (kappa = 0.850). This study demonstrates that it is possible to train a neural network to provide reliable decision support for lower-third-molar treatment planning.

AB  - The objective of this report was to provide an overview of the current landscape of big data analytics in the healthcare sector, introduce various approaches of machine learning and discuss potential implications in the field of orthodontics. With the increasing availability of data from various sources, the traditional analytical methods may not be conducive anymore for examining clinical outcomes. Machine-learning approaches, which are algorithms trained to identify patterns in large data sets, are ideally suited to facilitate data-driven decision making. The field of orthodontics is particularly ripe for embracing the big data analytics platform to improve decision making in clinical practice. The availability of omics data, state-of-the-art imaging and potential for establishing large clinical data repositories have favourably positioned the specialty of orthodontics to deliver personalized and precision orthodontic care. Specifically, we discuss about next-generation sequencing, radiomics in the context of CBCT imaging, and how centralized data repositories can enable real-time data pooling from multiple sources. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - The work is devoted to the development of a protocol for digital planning of dental treatment with the use of high-precision instruments and confirmation of its clinical effectiveness. A detailed analysis of the diagnostic and planning resources of dental treatment was carried out at the first stage of this study to optimize and structure them into a single digital complex. The analysis of cone-beam computed tomography results was provided with the artificial intelligence technology called Diagnocat. We compared the automated software report with the description of the radiographic scans of the same patients for the validation of artificial intelligence compiled by dental experts, who have continuous record of service in the specialty for more than 10 years in the specialization. To confirm the clinical effectiveness of the developed digital dental planning, 109 patients were examined who demanded aesthetic porcelain restorations in the maxillary arch. The study included 48 patients, randomly divided into a study group and a control group of 24 patients. At the end of the prototype, all patients were surveyed to assess the quality of life and satisfied dental treatment using OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile) questionnaire. In total, according to the results of the report analysis compiled by an expert group and a software based on artificial intelligence, 439 pathologies were identified in 638 teeth. The obtained results of the CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) analysis give grounds to draw conclusions about the obvious superiority of artificial intelligence technology in terms of the time spent on diagnostics and the quality of dental patient radiological description. Summarizing the results of the questionnaire survey based on the OHIP-14 questionnaire, we can conclude that the quality of life of patients has doubled according to the results of the digital dental treatment planning complex. © 2021, Yerevan State Medical University.

AB  - Objective: Despite all advantages provided by the digital workflow, its application in clinical practice is still more focused on device manufacturing and clinical execution than on treatment planning and communication. The most challenging phases of treatment, comprehensive planning, diagnosis, risk assessment, and decision-making, are still performed without significant assistance from digital technologies. This article proposes a new dental software classification based on the digital workflow timeline, considering the moment of patient's case acceptance as key in this classification, and presents the ideal software tools for each phase. Clinical Considerations: The proposed classification will help clinicians and dental laboratories to choose the most appropriate software during the treatment planning phase and integrate virtual plans with other software platforms for digitally guided execution. A dento-facial interdisciplinary planning platform virtually simulates interdisciplinary clinical procedures and assists in the decision-making process. Conclusions: The suggested classification assists professionals in different phases of the digital workflow and provides guidelines for improvement and development of digital technologies before treatment plan acceptance by the patient. Clinical Significance: Three-dimensional interdisciplinary simulations allow clinicians to visualize how each dental procedure influences further treatments. With this treatment planning approach, predictability of different procedures in restorative dentistry, orthodontics, implant dentistry, periodontal, and oral maxillofacial surgery is improved. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - This report illustrates the application of digital work-up as a dental treatment planning tool for prosthodontic patients. A clinical case was selected according to the prosthodontic needs. The conventional work-up was performed in accordance with the traditional prosthodontic criteria. The digital work-up was com-prised of scanning of the pre-treatment models followed by restor-ing the deficient teeth and replacement of the missing teeth. The two diagnostic work-up models were compared in relation to the modified teeth, soft tissue and occlusal contacts. It appears that the digital work-up is a feasible option and allows quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the dental treatment impact.

AB  - Automated identification of landmarks on lateral cephalogram and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans can save time for the clinicians and act as a second set of eyes for analysis of radiographic images in diagnosis and treatment planning. Several machine-learning techniques have been utilized for this purpose with varying accuracies. However, high degree of variability in the clinical presentation of orthodontic patients, limitations of the algorithms, lack of labelled data, high compute power, etc. are some drawbacks that have limited robust clinical application of such techniques. In recent years, artificial neural networks like deep learning and more specifically deep neural networks are making significant inroads in the true adoption of this technology. YOLOv3 and Single Shot Multibox Detector are some of the deep learning algorithms that have shown promising results. This paper is a theoretical review of the evolution of these technologies and the current state of the art in orthodontic image analysis. © 2021

AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a hereditary disorder that causes developmental alterations in the structure of enamel. In addition, tooth sensitivity, missing or impacted teeth, taurodontism, altered dental esthetics and anterior open bite can also be associated with AI. This clinical report presents the diagnosis, treatment planning and prosthetic rehabilitation of a 19-year-old female patient with AI associated with a group of dental anomalies. Following clinical and radiographic examination, histologic evaluation of the teeth confirmed the diagnosis of rough pattern hypoplastic AI. The patient was rehabilitated with full-mouth zirconium oxide ceramic fixed bridges. Adaptation of the temporomandibular joints and masticatory muscles to the bridges was carefully observed over 3 years. At the end of this follow-up period, the patient was satisfied with the esthetics, function and phonation of her prostheses. © 2014 Canadian Dental Association.

AB  - As automated treatment planning is expected to reduce inter-planner variability and the planning time allocated for the optimization process in order to improve the plan quality, researchers have attempted to develop such systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) attempts to reflect advanced human intelligence in machines, and efforts to develop AI systems have been made since the advent of computers. In the 1980s, an expert system that expressed expert knowledge in a program produced useful results as AI technology. However, because it was a system in which rules were embedded in advance, it was limited by its difficulty in handling exceptions. Furthermore, making rules is time-consuming. The importance of machine learning that inductively learns general rules and laws based on various events (data) became recognized in the 1990s. Machine learning techniques can be said to be general-purpose techniques for detecting regularity and specificity in observational data. In this chapter, we will introduce several AI systems that have been used to derive orthodontic diagnoses and develop treatment plans in the past. We will then introduce a newly developed AI system that uses natural language processing to conduct various clinical text evaluations and develop accompanying treatment protocols. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Clinical applications of 3D image registration and superimposition have contributed to better understanding growth changes and clinical outcomes. The use of 3D dental and craniofacial imaging in dentistry requires validate image analysis methods for improved diagnosis, treatment planning, navigation and assessment of treatment response. Volumetric 3D images, such as cone-beam computed tomography, can now be superimposed by voxels, surfaces or landmarks. Regardless of the image modality or the software tools, the concepts of regions or points of reference affect all quantitative of qualitative assessments. This study reviews current state of the art in 3D image analysis including 3D superimpositions relative to the cranial base and different regional superimpositions, the development of open source and commercial tools for 3D analysis, how this technology has increased clinical research collaborations from centres all around the globe, some insight on how to incorporate artificial intelligence for big data analysis and progress towards personalized orthodontics. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background/purpose: In the recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized in the field of dentistry. The aim of this systematic review was to document the scope and performance of the artificial intelligence based models that have been widely used in orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and predicting the prognosis. Materials and methods: The literature for this paper was identified and selected by performing a thorough search for articles in the electronic data bases like Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Google scholar, Scopus and Web of science, Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000–February 2020). After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. QUADAS-2 were adapted for quality analysis of the studies included. Results: AI technology has been widely applied for identifying cephalometric landmarks, determining need for orthodontic extractions, determining the degree of maturation of the cervical vertebra, predicting the facial attractiveness after orthognathic surgery, predicting the need for orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment planning. Most of these artificial intelligence models are based on either artificial neural networks (ANNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Conclusion: The results from these reported studies are suggesting that these automated systems have performed exceptionally well, with an accuracy and precision similar to the trained examiners. These systems can simplify the tasks and provide results in quick time which can save the dentist time and help the dentist to perform his duties more efficiently. These systems can be of great value in orthodontics. © 2020 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China

AB  - Lateral cephalometry has been widely used for skeletal classification in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this conventional system, requiring manual tracing of individual landmarks, contains possible errors of inter- and intravariability and is highly time-consuming. This study aims to provide an accurate and robust skeletal diagnostic system by incorporating a convolutional neural network (CNN) into a 1-step, end-to-end diagnostic system with lateral cephalograms. A multimodal CNN model was constructed on the basis of 5,890 lateral cephalograms and demographic data as an input. The model was optimized with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. Diagnostic performance was evaluated with statistical analysis. The proposed system exhibited >90% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for vertical and sagittal skeletal diagnosis. Clinical performance of the vertical classification showed the highest accuracy at 96.40 (95% CI, 93.06 to 98.39; model III). The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve both demonstrated the excellent performance of the system, with a mean area under the curve >95%. The heat maps of cephalograms were also provided for deeper understanding of the quality of the learned model by visually representing the region of the cephalogram that is most informative in distinguishing skeletal classes. In addition, we present broad applicability of this system through subtasks. The proposed CNN-incorporated system showed potential for skeletal orthodontic diagnosis without the need for intermediary steps requiring complicated diagnostic procedures. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2020.

AB  - Background. Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases observed in elderly patients. The development of preventive strategies for dental caries in elderly individuals is vital. Objective. The objective of the present study was to construct a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) prediction model for the risk assessment of dental caries among the geriatric residents of Liaoning, China. Methods. A stratified equal-capacity random sampling method was used to randomly select 1144 elderly (65-74 years) residents (gender ratio 1: 1) of Liaoning, China. Data for the oral assessment, including caries characteristics, and questionnaire survey from each participant were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed to identify the independent predictors. GRNN was applied to establish a prediction model for dental caries. The accuracy of the unconditional logistic regression and the GRNN early warning model was compared. Results. A total of 1144 patients fulfilled the requirements and completed the questionnaires. The caries rate was 68.5%, and the main associated factors were toothache history, residence area, smoking, and drinking. We randomly divided the data for the 1144 participants into a training set (915 cases) and a test set (229 cases). The optimal smoothing factor was 0.7, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the GRNN model was 0.626 (95% confidence interval, 0.544 to 0.708), with a P value of 0.002. In terms of consistency, sensitivity, and specificity, the GRNN model was better than the traditional unconditional multivariate logistic regression model. Conclusion. Geriatric (65-74 years) residents of Liaoning, China, have a high rate of dental caries. Residents with a history of toothache and smoking habits are more susceptible to the disease. The GRNN early warning model is an accurate and meaningful tool for screening, early diagnosis, and treatment planning for geriatric individuals with a high risk of caries. © 2020 Lu Liu et al.

AB  - Objectives: This paper provides an overview of existing applications and concepts of robotic systems and artificial intelligence in dentistry. This review aims to provide the community with novel inputs and argues for an increased utilization of these recent technological developments, referred to as Dentronics, in order to advance dentistry. Methods: First, background on developments in robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reviewed that may enable novel assistive applications in dentistry (Sec A). Second, a systematic technology review that evaluates existing state-of-the-art applications in AI, ML and robotics in the context of dentistry is presented (Sec B). Results: A systematic literature research in pubmed yielded in a total of 558 results. 41 studies related to ML, 53 studies related to AI and 49 original research papers on robotics application in dentistry were included. ML and AI have been applied in dental research to analyze large amounts of data to eventually support dental decision making, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning with the help of data-driven analysis algorithms based on machine learning. So far, only few robotic applications have made it to reality, mostly restricted to pilot use cases. Significance: The authors believe that dentistry can greatly benefit from the current rise of digital human-centered automation and be transformed towards a new robotic, ML and AI-enabled era. In the future, Dentronics will enhance reliability, reproducibility, accuracy and efficiency in dentistry through the democratized use of modern dental technologies, such as medical robot systems and specialized artificial intelligence. Dentronics will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis, improve risk-assessment-strategies, diagnosis, disease prediction and finally lead to better treatment outcomes. © 2020 The Academy of Dental Materials

AB  - The complete dental rehabilitation of patients with a vertical dimension loss (VDL) caused by structural enamel deficits associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) represents a difficult challenge for restorative teams. Accurate analysis and treatment planning that includes esthetic and functional evaluations and adequate material selection are important prerequisites for successful results. Long-term provisional restorations play an important role in exploring and elucidating the patients' esthetic demands and functional needs. Restorative treatment options can vary from requiring only oral hygiene instructions to extensive dental restorations that include composite fillings, ceramic veneers, metal-ceramic, or all-ceramic crowns. This case report describes a full-mouth rehabilitation of a patient with amelogenesis imperfecta including the case planning, bite replacement, preparation, and restoration setting steps with an experimental CAD/CAM polymer and porcelain veneers. © Quintessenz.

AB  - Background: In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak started in China and rapidly spread around the world. Lack of a vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of patients with COVID-19. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19-positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. Results: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. Conclusions: Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments. ©Jouhyun Jeon, Gaurav Baruah, Sarah Sarabadani, Adam Palanica.

AB  - Over the past two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have undergone considerable development. There have been various applications in medicine and dentistry. Their application in orthodontics has progressed slowly, despite promising results. The available literature pertaining to the orthodontic applications of AI and ML has not been adequately synthesized and reviewed. This review article provides orthodontists with an overview of AI and ML, along with their applications. It describes state-of-the-art applications in the areas of orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, growth evaluations, and in the prediction of treatment outcomes. AI and ML are powerful tools that can be utilized to overcome some of the clinical problems that orthodontists face daily. With the availability of more data, better AI and ML systems should be expected to be developed that will help orthodontists practice more efficiently and improve the quality of care. ©2019 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of APOS Trends in Orthodontics.

AB  - Objective: This case will illustrate the interdisciplinary management of an adolescent female patient with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI). It will contrast this approach and compare it to the previous “multidisciplinary” treatment rendered before the patient was referred for a second opinion. Clinical considerations: The patient had a family history of AI affecting all of her permanent teeth. There were many impacted teeth. The majority of her family and relatives afflicted by this opted for dentures. The patient had undergone 2 years of treatment and was told that her “braces would be removed next week.” Her new dentist was concerned because the case was not ready to restore. Conclusion: He recommended referral to another orthodontist for a second opinion and formulation of an interdisciplinary treatment plan that would include a periodontist, endodontist, and restorative dentist. The patient's family accepted the second opinion referral and restarted treatment with an interdisciplinary team. The restorative dentist was the quarterback for this integrated and sequenced approach. The case was ultimately restored. A 35 year follow-up shows stability with a caries free, periodontally healthy, esthetic result. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This paper aims to combine two different imaging techniques to create an accurate 3D model representation of root canals and dental crowns. We combine Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) (root canals) and Intra Oral Scans (IOS) (dental crowns). The Root Canal Segmentation algorithm relies on a U-Net architecture with 2D sliced images from CBCT scans as its input. The segmentation task achieved an F1-score of 0.84. The IOS segmentation (Dental Model Segmentation) algorithm and Universal Labeling and Merging (ULM) algorithm use a multi-view approach for 3D shape analysis. The approach consists of acquiring views of the 3D object from different viewpoints and extract surface features such as the normal vectors. The generated 2D images are then analyzed via a 2D convolutional neural networks (U-Net) for segmentation or classification tasks. The segmentation task on IOS achieved an accuracy of 0.9. The ULM algorithm classifies the jaws between upper and lower and aligns them to a template and labels each crown and root with the ‘Universal Numbering System’ proposed by the ‘American Dental Association’. The ULM task achieve an F1-score of 0.85. Merging and annotation of CBCT and IOS imaging modalities will help guide clinical decision support and quantitative treatment planning for specific teeth, implant placement, root canal treatment, restorative procedures, or biomechanics of tooth movement in orthodontics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - CONTEXT: In the last few decades, data acquisition and processing has seen tremendous amount of growth, thus sparking interest in machine learning (ML) within the health care system. OBJECTIVE: Our aim for this review is to provide an evidence map of the current available evidence on ML in pediatrics and adolescent medicine and provide insight for future research. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted by using Medline, the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Web of Science Library, and EBSCO Dentistry & Oral Science Source. STUDY SELECTION: Articles in which an ML model was assessed for the diagnosis, prediction, or management of any condition in children and adolescents (0-18 years) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted for year of publication, geographical location, age range, number of participants, disease or condition under investigation, study methodology, reference standard, type, category, and performance of ML algorithms. RESULTS: The review included 363 studies, with subspecialties such as psychiatry, neonatology, and neurology having the most literature. A majority of the studies were from high-income (82%; n = 296) and upper middle-income countries (15%; n = 56), whereas only 3% (n = 11) were from low middle-income countries. Neural networks and ensemble methods were most commonly tested in the 1990s, whereas deep learning and clustering emerged rapidly in the current decade. LIMITATIONS: Only studies conducted in the English language could be used in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The interest in ML has been growing across various subspecialties and countries, suggesting a potential role in health service delivery for children and adolescents in the years to come.

AB  - Objectives: Evaluating children’s oral health status and treatment needs is challenging. We aim to build oral health assessment toolkits to predict Children’s Oral Health Status Index (COHSI) score and referral for treatment needs (RFTN) of oral health. Parent and Child toolkits consist of short-form survey items (12 for children and 8 for parents) with and without children’s demographic information (7 questions) to predict the child’s oral health status and need for treatment. Methods: Data were collected from 12 dental practices in Los Angeles County from 2015 to 2016. We predicted COHSI score and RFTN using random Bootstrap samples with manually introduced Gaussian noise together with machine learning algorithms, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting and Naive Bayesian algorithms (using R). The toolkits predicted the probability of treatment needs and the COHSI score with percentile (ranking). The performance of the toolkits was evaluated internally and externally by residual mean square error (RMSE), correlation, sensitivity and specificity. Results: The toolkits were developed based on survey responses from 545 families with children aged 2 to 17 y. The sensitivity and specificity for predicting RFTN were 93% and 49% respectively with the external data. The correlation(s) between predicted and clinically determined COHSI was 0.88 (and 0.91 for its percentile). The RMSEs of the COHSI toolkit were 4.2 for COHSI (and 1.3 for its percentile). Conclusions: Survey responses from children and their parents/guardians are predictive for clinical outcomes. The toolkits can be used by oral health programs at baseline among school populations. The toolkits can also be used to quantify differences between pre- and post-dental care program implementation. The toolkits’ predicted oral health scores can be used to stratify samples in oral health research. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This study creates the oral health toolkits that combine self- and proxy- reported short forms with children’s demographic characteristics to predict children’s oral health and treatment needs using Machine Learning algorithms. The toolkits can be used by oral health programs at baseline among school populations to quantify differences between pre and post dental care program implementation. The toolkits can also be used to stratify samples according to the treatment needs and oral health status. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2019.

AB  - Accurate and automatic segmentation of individual tooth is critical for computer-aided analysis towards clinical decision support and treatment planning. Three-dimensional reconstruction of individual tooth after the segmentation also plays an important role in simulation in digital orthodontics. However, it is difficult to automatically segment individual tooth in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images due to the blurring boundaries of neighboring teeth and the similar intensities between teeth and mandible bone. In this work, we propose the use of a multi-task 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) and marker-controlled watershed transform (MWT) to segment individual tooth. The multi-task FCN learns to simultaneously predict the probability of tooth region and the probability of tooth surface. Through the combination of the tooth probability gradient map and the surface probability map as the input image, MWT is used to automatically separate and segment individual tooth. Twenty-five dental CBCT scans are used in the study. The average Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard index, and relative volume difference are 0.936 (±0.012), 0.881 (±0.019), and 0.072 (±0.027), respectively, and the average symmetric surface distance is 0.363 (±0.145) mm for our method. The experimental results demonstrate that the multi-task 3D FCN combined with MWT can segment individual tooth of various types in dental CBCT images. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The term “artificial intelligence” (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization. Existing treatment recommendations suggest resin-composite restorations until adulthood, although such restorations have a limited longevity. New crown materials allow for minimal preparation techniques. The aim of this study was to compare the quality and longevity of 2 crown types - Procera and IPS e.max Press - in adolescents and young adults with AI. A secondary aim was to document adverse events. We included 27 patients (11 to 22 y of age) with AI in need of crown therapy in a randomized controlled trial using a split-mouth technique. After placing 119 Procera crowns and 108 IPS e.max Press crowns following randomization, we recorded longevity, quality, adverse events, and tooth sensitivity. After 2 y, 97% of the crowns in both crown groups had excellent or acceptable quality. We found no significant differences in quality between Procera and IPS e.max Press crowns. Tooth sensitivity was significantly reduced after crown therapy (P < 0.001). Endodontic complications occurred in 3% of crowns. The results show that it is possible to perform crown therapy with excellent results and without severe complications in young patients with AI.

AB  - The aim of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANN) for predicting the treatment planning of maxillary implant-supported prosthesis as a challenging problem in dentistry. The clinical data of 35 patients is used to train a multilayer perceptron neural network with a 10-20-2 structure. The activation functions are tangent hyperbolic and linear function in the hidden and output layers respectively. For learning process, the normalized form of inputs/outputs is given to the ANN. The designed network successfully learned the input-output relations for the cases of training data bank. Moreover, the ability of the ANN to treat some new cases has been demonstrated and discussed. It is concluded that neural networks may initially seem complex and computer intensive, but they actually integrate well with a clinical environment. Also, neural network expert systems may be trained with clinical data to become important decision making tools within dentistry and have applications both in improving clinical care and in maximizing the cost benefit of care.

AB  - The written documentation generated in the dental practice can only be used for clinical tasks under certain conditions. The systematic use of clinical information is not possible until therapy and record data are organized as empirical bases of knowledge by electronic application. Then all documented data are available to support clinical decisions. The first task of dental treatment planning is the assessment of the individualized prognosis. Empirical bases of knowledge can process the surveyed information for this purpose and present it in a suitable manner. Moreover, an empirical basis of knowledge is suitable for an analysis of the effectiveness of dental therapy measures and for the elaboration of empirical foundations for discussion between colleagues. The most advanced form of data application is the expert system, which is able to carry out case comparisons and draw model-based conclusions on the basis of empirical knowledge.

AB  - Medical imaging techniques, such as (cone beam) computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have proven to be a valuable component for oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS). Accurate segmentation of the mandible from head and neck (H&N) scans is an important step in order to build a personalized 3D digital mandible model for 3D printing and treatment planning of OMFS. Segmented mandible structures are used to effectively visualize the mandible volumes and to evaluate particular mandible properties quantitatively. However, mandible segmentation is always challenging for both clinicians and researchers, due to complex structures and higher attenuation materials, such as teeth (filling) or metal implants that easily lead to high noise and strong artifacts during scanning. Moreover, the size and shape of the mandible vary to a large extent between individuals. Therefore, mandible segmentation is a tedious and time-consuming task and requires adequate training to be performed properly. With the advancement of computer vision approaches, researchers have developed several algorithms to automatically segment the mandible during the last two decades. The objective of this review was to present the available fully (semi)automatic segmentation methods of the mandible published in different scientific articles. This review provides a vivid description of the scientific advancements to clinicians and researchers in this field to help develop novel automatic methods for clinical applications. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Orthodontic diagnosis is a comprehensive procedure that integrates various information obtained from the facial and occlusal structure as well as patient's individual needs. Hence it is not easy to imagine if the artificial intelligence(AI) would eventually replace the conventional diagnostic process. Nonetheless, recent advances in the machine learning and artificial intelligence have been applied to the cephalometric tracing and model analysis via automated image recognition, exhibiting relatively high reliability. Based on the cumulated experiences and research outcomes, orthodontic diagnostics have taken a small step towards an automated process. Considering that the orthodontic diagnosis starts from the recognition of the space discrepancy between the initial status and idealized occlusion, semi-automated three-dimensional visualized treatment objectives (VTO) may be established. This article covers the brief overview of the current status in machine learning especially focusing on the image recognition. Recent advances in the fabrication of three-dimensional VTO using surface landmarks and automated setup process is demonstrated. In the near future, a more clinically relevant VTO can be utilized using the imaginary center of resistance, to provide useful clues to the orthodontists in many of the borderline cases between extraction and non-extraction, and between surgery and non-surgery. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Planning of treatment in the field of orthodontics and maxillo-facial surgery is largely dependent on the individual growth of a patient. In the present work, the growth of 43 orthodontically untreated children was analysed by means of lateral cephalograms taken at the ages of 7 and 15. For the description of craniofacial skeletal changes, the concept of tenser analysis and related methods have been applied. Thus the geometric and analytical shortcomings of conventional cephalometric methods have been avoided. Through the use of an artificial neural network, namely self-organizing neural maps, the resultant growth data were classified and the relationships of the various growth patterns were monitored. As a result of self-organization, the 43 children were topologically ordered on the emerging map according to their craniofacial size and shape changes during growth. As a new patient can be allocated on the map, this type of network provides a frame of reference for classifying and analysing previously unknown cases with respect to their growth pattern. If landmarks are used for the determination of growth, the morphometric methods applied as well as the subsequent visualization of the growth data by means of neural networks can be employed for the analysis and classification of growth-related skeletal changes in general.

AB  - Intraoral scanners have been used to capture data for the design and subsequent manufacture of dental restorations and also for registering color clinical images. Scanners can capture datasets for future use and comparisons. This manuscript describes the potential of using software algorithms to superimpose 3D images captured at different times to calculate dimensional changes at the click of a button in various dental fields. 3D patient monitoring, with the advance of artificial intelligence and its built-in capacity for data analyses, will allow dentists and researchers to calculate volumetric changes and predict potentially adverse clinical outcomes. © 2021. by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.

AB  - The lateral cephalogram analysis is an important method of a research in orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery that allows to obtain necessary diagnostic information on a structure of brain and facial skull parts for treatment planning. There are numerous techniques of the analysis based on processing of cephalometric points (markers) on the lateral cephalogram. Such approaches take a considerable time for the doctor to arrange cephalometric points. Modern digital technologies with use of artificial intelligence allow to improve this method of a research and to significantly simplify doctor’s work. Purpose. In this paper, we propose a neural network and training strategy that enables to place cephalometric points on the lateral cephalogram with high precision. Materials and methods. The research used 80 lateral cephalograms of the head. Results. The developed method handles the cephalograms regardless of the source of the image, while error percentage below 2% of the size of the images. The offered approach demands 2-3 times less time than a traditional "manual" method of arrangement of cephalometric points, depending on quantity of points and complexity of the cephalometric analysis. © 2018 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

AB  - Purpose of Review: During the last few years, the interest in fabrication of computer-engineered removable complete dentures has grown intensively. Innovative clinical and technological advances are driving forces. They allow (i) the creation of new and more efficient workflows, (ii) an emergence of modified and easier procedures, and (iii) the use of alternative biomaterials with improved properties. The results are a better fit and retention of the digital complete dentures, as well as a generally high satisfaction of patient and clinician, while reducing the number of appointments and the technical input. The purpose of this narrative review is to present the historical, clinical, and technological developments in the field of digital removable complete dentures and to evaluate the future potential of this technology. Recent Findings: The fabrication of a digital complete denture either by milling separately the base and the denture teeth set-up or by milling a monolithic denture is well investigated. Concurrently the trend for fabricating complete denture bases by using the 3D print technology is growing. There is plenty of research showing that milling dentures from standardized pre-polymerized polymethyl methacrylate pucks guarantee the fabrication of homogenous objects with excellent biomaterial properties. The results indicate a better base adaptation, a higher flexural strength, an improved resistance to denture staining, and no polymerization distortion while milling. Furthermore, a sophisticated milling strategy allows to obtain a detailed and accurate intaglio and cameo surface, which is even exceeded when 3D printing. The clinical and technological freedom, to either combine selectively analog and digital steps or to take a totally digital workflow ending with milling or 3D printing, opens countless opportunities in the field of removable complete dentures. Whatever steps are taken, whatever sophisticated technology is chosen, still only the professional and individual know-how of the dentist in combination with the manual skills and the experience of the dental technologist—including especially the finish of the final product—will lead to a superior teamwork result. Limitations inherent to the milling process are the waste of raw material, the wear of milling tools, and the challenge to access undercut areas; the reasons are the milling bur size, the number of milling axes, and the limited movements of the machining axes. The advantages of additive manufacturing lay in a high resolution of complex geometries and a reduced waste of the biomaterial. As a limitation, the accuracy of the object, i.e. deformation, may be affected by several fabrication parameters, such as the polymerization light intensity, the build direction and angle, the layer thickness and numbers, the amount of supporting structures, and the post-processing procedures. However, with improved materials and techniques, printing may also become a primary method for fabricating digital complete dentures. Summary: The available clinical and technical information and multiple research demonstrate that the integration of digital steps into the workflow for fabricating removable complete dentures opens countless options, leading to the achievement of an esthetically, functionally, biologically, and technically high-quality end product. However, a longer learning curve must be considered. To simplify the fabrication methods of complete dentures in specific clinical situations, with the aim to increase efficiency and to save resources, is indicated. However, the use of conventional step-by-step approaches may still be valid for complex clinical situations. It is foreseeable that for treating edentulous patients, the evolution of new biomaterials, the introduction of sophisticated digital methods, and the development of improved software will follow attractive workflows with more standardized, easier, achievable, and predictable results. It challenges the clinician to have a more direct impact on denture construction and to provide the patient with the opportunity to participate in the esthetic designing. A generally higher efficiency and satisfaction for all partners involved in the fabrication process of removable complete dentures—patient, dental technologist, and dentist/prosthodontist—is the result. For a dental technologist, it is a great challenge to set up esthetic and functional denture teeth in an edentulous 3D space defined by the maxilla, the mandible, and the oral soft tissues. It is a question of time and partly already existing that machine learning—a branch of artificial intelligence—has the capacity to recognize specific intramaxillary and intermaxillary situations and to deliver an acceptable functional and esthetic denture teeth set-up, at least as a working base. Furthermore, with the introduction of a face scanner, the patient becomes virtually present anytime. Transferring the virtual situation in a physical articulator makes judgments and changes possible in both worlds simultaneously. Innovations such as robot technology still are in their infancy; however, there are aspirations to automatically place denture teeth into a dental arch. There is a great responsibility for a dentist and a dental technologist for fabricating high-quality removable complete dentures. Factors, such as a meticulous diagnosis and treatment planning, a personal communication between the involved persons, and a profound knowledge of the clinical and technical possibilities, should lead to an easy, simple, cost-effective, and highly satisfying denture fabrication workflow. The digitalization in this field already has and will even more activate research and clinical opportunities in the near future. The globally existing many edentulous patients will highly appreciate the excellent results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Expert systems are increasingly being used to provide comprehensive interpretative services for diagnosis and treatment planning. Some of these systems are constrained by the complexities of rule-based strategies and a need for knowledge engineers throughout the maintenance phase. A new approach to knowledge acquisition known as Ripple-Down-Rules was used in the development of EICO-1 (Expert Interpretation in Clinical Orthodontics). This expert-maintained system for automating orthodontic reports has a knowledge base of six hundred and eighty rules, and is maintained by an expert trained only in Orthodontics and without the help of knowledge engineers. EICO-1 is the first expert system in Dentistry to use Ripple-Down-Rules. It has potential as an interactive advisory tool and is applicable in a clinical situation.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyse and review deep learning convolutional neural networks for detecting and diagnosing early-stage dental caries on periapical radiographs. Materials and Methods: In order to conduct this review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies published from 2015 to 2021 under the keywords (deep convolutional neural network) AND (caries), (deep learning caries) AND (convolutional neural network) AND (caries) were systematically reviewed. Results: When dental caries is improperly diagnosed, the lesion may eventually invade the enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue, leading to loss of tooth function. Rapid and precise detection and diagnosis are vital for implementing appropriate prevention and treatment of dental caries. Radiography and intraoral images are considered to play a vital role in detecting dental caries; nevertheless, studies have shown that 20% of suspicious areas are mistakenly diagnosed as dental caries using this technique; hence, diagnosis via radiography alone without an objective assessment is inaccurate. Identifying caries with a deep convolutional neural network-based detector enables the operator to distinguish changes in the location and morphological features of dental caries lesions. Deep learning algorithms have broader and more profound layers and are continually being developed, remarkably enhancing their precision in detecting and segmenting objects. Conclusion: Clinical applications of deep learning convolutional neural networks in the dental field have shown significant accuracy in detecting and diagnosing dental caries, and these models hold promise in supporting dental practitioners to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Tooth segmentation on cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging is a labor-intensive task considering the limited contrast resolution and potential disturbance by various artifacts. Fully automated tooth segmentation cannot be achieved by merely relying on CBCT intensity variations. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tool for automated tooth segmentation on CBCT imaging. Methods: A total of 433 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine images of single- and double-rooted teeth randomly selected from 314 anonymized CBCT scans were imported and manually segmented. An AI-driven tooth segmentation algorithm based on a feature pyramid network was developed to automatically detect and segment teeth, replacing manual user contour placement. The AI-driven tool was evaluated based on volume comparison, intersection over union, the Dice score coefficient, morphologic surface deviation, and total segmentation time. Results: Overall, AI-driven and clinical reference segmentations resulted in very similar segmentation volumes. The mean intersection over union for full-tooth segmentation was 0.87 (±0.03) and 0.88 (±0.03) for semiautomated (SA) (clinical reference) versus fully automated AI-driven (F-AI) and refined AI-driven (R-AI) tooth segmentation, respectively. R-AI and F-AI segmentation showed an average median surface deviation from SA segmentation of 9.96 μm (±59.33 μm) and 7.85 μm (±69.55 μm), respectively. SA segmentations of single- and double-rooted teeth had a mean total time of 6.6 minutes (±76.15 seconds), F-AI segmentation of 0.5 minutes (±8.64 seconds, 12 times faster), and R-AI segmentation of 1.2 minutes (±33.02 seconds, 6 times faster). Conclusions: This study showed a unique fast and accurate approach for AI-driven automated tooth segmentation on CBCT imaging. These results may open doors for AI-driven applications in surgical and treatment planning in oral health care. © 2021 American Association of Endodontists

AB  - Background: Early childhood dental care (ECDC) is a significant public health opportunity since dental caries is largely preventable and a prime target for reducing healthcare expenditures. This study aims to discover underlying patterns in ECDC utilization among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, which have significant implications for public health prevention, innovative service delivery models, and targeted cost-saving interventions. Methods: Using 9 years of longitudinal Medicaid data of 24,223 publicly insured child members of an accountable care organization (ACO), Partners for Kids in Ohio, we applied unsupervised machine learning to cluster patients based on their cumulative dental cost curves in early childhood (24–60 months). Clinical validity, analytical validity, and reproducibility were assessed. Results: The clustering revealed five novel subpopulations: (1) early-onset of decay by age (0.5% of the population, as early as 28 months), (2) middle-onset of decay (3.0%, as early as 35 months), (3) late-onset of decay (5.8%, as early as 44 months), (4) regular preventive care (67.7%), and (5) zero utilization (23.0%). Patients with early-onset of decay incurred the highest dental cost [median annual cost (MAC) = $9,499, InterQuartile Range (IQR): $7,052–$11,216], while patients with regular preventive care incurred the lowest dental cost (MAC = $191, IQR: $99–$336). We also found a plausible correlation of early-onset of decay with complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0–24 months. Almost one-third of patients with early-onset of decay had complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0–24 months. Patients with early-onset of decay also incurred the highest medical cost (MAC = $7,513, IQR: $4,527–$12,546) at 0–24 months. Conclusion: Among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, five subpopulations with distinctive clinical, cost, and utilization patterns were discovered and validated through a data-driven approach. This novel discovery promotes innovative prevention strategies that differentiate Medicaid subpopulations, and allows for the development of cost-effective interventions that target high-risk patients. Furthermore, an integrated medical-dental care delivery model promises to reduce costs further while improving patient outcomes. © Copyright © 2021 Peng, Zeng, Townsend, Liu, Huang and Lin.

AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder that disturbs the developing enamel structure. This enamel anomaly affects both the primary and permanent dentitions. The aim of this article was to describe through a series of cases, the therapeutic management of children with AI. The purpose of the treatments were to eliminate tooth sensitivity while enhancing aesthetics and restoring masticatory function. Treatment planning is related to the age of the patient, the type and severity of the disorder, and the oral health of the patient. Early diagnosis, preventive care and timely treatment are important to improve oral health in children with AI. © Elelmi Y, Chayma BA 2020.

AB  - Objectives: Automatic tooth segmentation and classification from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) have become an integral component of the digital dental workflows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning approach for an automatic tooth segmentation and classification from CBCT images. Methods: A dataset of 186 CBCT scans was acquired from two CBCT machines with different acquisition settings. An artificial intelligence (AI) framework was built to segment and classify teeth. Teeth were segmented in a three-step approach with each step consisting of a 3D U-Net and step 2 included classification. The dataset was divided into training set (140 scans) to train the model based on ground-truth segmented teeth, validation set (35 scans) to test the model performance and test set (11 scans) to evaluate the model performance compared to ground-truth. Different evaluation metrics were used such as precision, recall rate and time. Results: The AI framework correctly segmented teeth with optimal precision (0.98±0.02) and recall (0.83±0.05). The difference between the AI model and ground-truth was 0.56±0.38 mm based on 95% Hausdorff distance confirming the high performance of AI compared to ground-truth. Furthermore, segmentation of all the teeth within a scan was more than 1800 times faster for AI compared to that of an expert. Teeth classification also performed optimally with a recall rate of 98.5% and precision of 97.9%. Conclusions: The proposed 3D U-Net based AI framework is an accurate and time-efficient deep learning system for automatic tooth segmentation and classification without expert refinement. Clinical significance: The proposed system might enable potential future applications for diagnostics and treatment planning in the field of digital dentistry, while reducing clinical workload. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization associated with poor esthetics and dental sensitivity. Because the condition is associated with negative social outcomes, this study evaluated oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), dental fear, and dental beliefs before and after early prosthetic crown therapy for AI during adolescence. Methods: The study included 69 patients with AI, aged 6-25 yr: 33 males and 36 females (mean age 14.5 ± 4.3); healthy controls (n = 80), patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP; n = 30), and patients with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH; n = 39). All matched in age and gender, and all but the CLP group insocioeconomic area. Patients completed three questionnaires measuring OHRQoL (OHIP-14), dental fear (CFSS-DS), and dental beliefs (DBS-R). Twenty-six patients with severe AI between ages 9 and 22 yr received crown therapy and completed the questionnaires twice: before and after therapy. Results: OHIP-14 scores were significantly higher among patients with AI (7.0 ± 6.7), MIH (6.8 ± 7.6) and CLP (13.6 ± 12.1) than healthy controls (1.4 ± 2.4) (p < 0.001). After crown therapy, quality of life problems in the 26 patients with severe AI decreased significantly, from 7.8 ± 6.1 to 3.0 ± 4.8 (p < 0.001). Early prosthetic therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment. Conclusions:OHRQoL increased after early crown therapy in patients with severe AI. Therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment. © 2015 Pousette Lundgren et al.

AB  - The practicability of deep learning techniques has been demonstrated by their successful implementation in varied fields, including diagnostic imaging for clinicians. In accordance with the increasing demands in the healthcare industry, techniques for automatic prediction and detection are being widely researched. Particularly in dentistry, for various reasons, automated mandibular canal detection has become highly desirable. The positioning of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), which is one of the major structures in the mandible, is crucial to prevent nerve injury during surgical procedures. However, automatic segmentation using Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) poses certain difficulties, such as the complex appearance of the human skull, limited number of datasets, unclear edges, and noisy images. Using work-in-progress automation software, experiments were conducted with models based on 2D SegNet, 2D and 3D U-Nets as preliminary research for a dental segmentation automation tool. The 2D U-Net with adjacent images demonstrates higher global accuracy of 0.82 than naïve U-Net variants. The 2D SegNet showed the second highest global accuracy of 0.96, and the 3D U-Net showed the best global accuracy of 0.99. The automated canal detection system through deep learning will contribute significantly to efficient treatment planning and to reducing patients’ discomfort by a dentist. This study will be a preliminary report and an opportunity to explore the application of deep learning to other dental fields. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Biomedical research has recently moved through three stages in digital healthcare: (1) data collection; (2) data sharing; and (3) data analytics. With the explosion of stored health data (HD), dental medicine is edging into its fourth stage of digitization using artificial intelligence (AI). This narrative literature review outlines the challenge of managing HD and anticipating the potential of AI in oral healthcare and dental research by summarizing the current literature. Summary: The basis of successful management of HD is the establishment of a generally accepted data standard that will guide its implementation within electronic health records (EHR) and health information technology ecosystems (HIT Eco). Thereby continuously adapted (self-) learning health systems (LHS) can be created. The HIT Eco of the future will combine (i) the front-end utilization of HD in clinical decision-making by providers using supportive diagnostic tools for patient-centered treatment planning, and (ii) back-end algorithms analyzing the standardized collected data to inform population-based policy decisions about resource allocations and research directions. Cryptographic methods in blockchain enable a safe, more efficient, and effective dental care within a global perspective. Key Message: The interoperability of HD with accessible digital health technologies is the key to deliver value-based dental care and exploit the tremendous potential of AI. © 2019 S.

AB  - Introduction: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various ways in medicine and dentistry. Advancements in AI technology show promising results in the practice of orthodontics. This scoping review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of AI-based models employed in orthodontic landmark detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Methods: A precise search of electronic databases was conducted, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase (English publications from January 2010 to July 2020). Quality Assessment and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool 2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the quality of the articles included in this review. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 49 articles were included in the final review. AI technology has achieved state-of-the-art results in various orthodontic applications, including automated landmark detection on lateral cephalograms and photography images, cervical vertebra maturation degree determination, skeletal classification, orthodontic tooth extraction decisions, predicting the need for orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery, and facial attractiveness. Most of the AI models used in these applications are based on artificial neural networks. Conclusions: AI can help orthodontists save time and provide accuracy comparable to the trained dentists in diagnostic assessments and prognostic predictions. These systems aim to boost performance and enhance the quality of care in orthodontics. However, based on current studies, the most promising application was cephalometry landmark detection, skeletal classification, and decision making on tooth extractions. © 2021 American Association of Orthodontists

AB  - Cephalometric analysis is basic assessment aid for orthodontics, oral maxillofacial surgery and treatment planning. The identification of landmark locations on lateral cephalograms plays a critical role in the clinical analysis, automating this process could reduce possible human errors and time consumption. This work explores the automation of landmark detection process using deep learning framework. The modified U-Net model has been trained on seven landmarks and implemented to locate the same in test images. The proposed model has been evaluated with dice metrics which was observed to be approximately 88 percent for each landmark. The successful detection rate has been calculated and compared with two other prominent methods, comparable results were achieved which comes under clinically acceptable range. This work is in the early stages as not many deep learning methods explored in this particular domain, which demonstrates assurance for improvement in computer-aided treatment and surgery planning. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in orthodontics, its translation into clinical practice, and what limitations do exist that have precluded their envisioned application. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was carried out following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PubMed was searched until July 2020. Results: Sixty-two articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 43 out of the 62 studies (69.35%) were published this last decade. The majority of these studies were from the USA (11), followed by South Korea (9) and China (7). The number of studies published in non-orthodontic journals (36) was more extensive than in orthodontic journals (26). Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were found to be the most commonly utilized AI/ML algorithm (13 studies), followed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (9 studies each), and regression (8 studies). The most commonly studied domains were diagnosis and treatment planning—either broad-based or specific (33), automated anatomic landmark detection and/or analyses (19), assessment of growth and development (4), and evaluation of treatment outcomes (2). The different characteristics and distribution of these studies have been displayed and elucidated upon therein. Conclusion: This scoping review suggests that there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies involving various orthodontic applications of AI and ML. The most commonly studied domains were diagnosis and treatment planning, automated anatomic landmark detection and/or analyses, and growth and development assessment. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the awareness of artificial intelligence among undergraduate dental students. Artificial intelligence is the work demonstrated by machines in contrast to natural intelligence. There are so many inventions in the field of dentistry which are used for diagnosis and treatment planning. The current study was a cross sectional survey conducted among 103 undergraduate dental students. A self structured questionnaire was circulated through online survey link-Google forms, data tabulated and analysed. The results were categorised as knowledge, attitude and practice. From these results we can conclude that most of the students were aware of artificial intelligence and they think AI is very useful for analysing patients and also some dental procedures. AI is useful for all the departments in dentistry. There are some advantages and disadvantages. Some of them agreed to use AI in their future clinic. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

AB  - Precisely labeling teeth on digitalized 3D dental surface models is the precondition for tooth position rearrangements in orthodontic treatment planning. However, it is a challenging task primarily due to the abnormal and varying appearance of patients' teeth. The emerging utilization of intraoral scanners (IOSs) in clinics further increases the difficulty in automated tooth labeling, as the raw surfaces acquired by IOS are typically low-quality at gingival and deep intraoral regions. In recent years, some pioneering end-to-end methods (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the communities of computer vision and graphics to consume directly raw surface for 3D shape segmentation. Although these methods are potentially applicable to our task, most of them fail to capture fine-grained local geometric context that is critical to the identification of small teeth with varying shapes and appearances. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method, called MeshSegNet, for automated tooth labeling on raw dental surfaces. Using multiple raw surface attributes as inputs, MeshSegNet integrates a series of graph-constrained learning modules along its forward path to hierarchically extract multi-scale local contextual features. Then, a dense fusion strategy is applied to combine local-to-global geometric features for the learning of higher-level features for mesh cell annotation. The predictions produced by our MeshSegNet are further post-processed by a graph-cut refinement step for final segmentation. We evaluated MeshSegNet using a real-patient dataset consisting of raw maxillary surfaces acquired by 3D IOS. Experimental results, performed 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrate that MeshSegNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 3D shape segmentation.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subdiscipline of computer science that has made substantial progress in medicine and there is a growing body of AI research in dentistry. Dentists should have an understanding of the foundational concepts and the ability to critically evaluate dental research in AI. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that most dental AI research is dedicated to. The most prolific area of ML research is automated interpretation of dental imaging. Other areas include providing treatment recommendations, predicting future disease and treatment outcomes. The research impact is limited by small datasets that do not harness the positive correlation between very large datasets and ML performance. There is also a need to standardize research methodologies and utilize performance metrics that are appropriate for the clinical context. In addition to research challenges, this article discusses the ethical, legal and logistical considerations associated with implementation in clinical practice. This includes explainable AI, model bias, data privacy and security. The future implications of AI in dentistry involve a promise for a novel form of practicing dentistry however, the effect of AI on patient outcomes is yet to be determined. © 2020 Australian Dental Association

AB  - Radiographs are X-rays of the craniofacial area, used for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Analysis of radiographs is a manual process. Public medical centers in developing countries such as South Africa experience a bottleneck in the analysis of these radiographs, due to excessive numbers of patients and severe shortages in orthodontic radiologists that serve at these public medical centers. Access to dental diagnostics is therefore becoming an ever-increasing problem in rural communities. This paper reports on the first phase of a framework to automate the analysis of panoramic radiographs, which are X-rays of the frontal croniofacial area. This first phase automates the process to predict whether a captured panoramic radiograph is workable or not, i.e. whether automated analysis of the X-ray can proceed. A is trained on a large set of panoramic radiographs, and results show that the prediction accuracy of this is very good in identifying workable radiographs. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) is an heterogenous genetic disorder that disturbs the developing enamel structure. This rare ectodermal defect leads to a variety of clinical manifestations due to agenesis, hypoplasia, and/or hypomineralisation of the enamel. To describe the prosthodontic management of dental anomalies commonly associated with AI. By using the classification of Witkop and Rao (1971), the variation in clinical presentation of the different Types of AI are illustrated and discussed, in particular Type I AI and Type 4 AI. Early diagnosis and prosthodontic management as part of a multidisciplinary, patient-centred approach are key factors to treatment success. Treatment options to address the oral complications are influenced by modifying factors including age, socioeconomic status, type and severity of the disorder, and intraoral status at the time of treatment planning. Ultimately, management includes pain and infection control, provision of aesthetics and restoration of function which may lead to patient satisfaction, psychological well-being and an improved quality of life.

AB  - In the past 20 years, the orthodontic profession has adopted digital technologies such as computer-assisted tooth movement, automated staged dental aligner production, and 3D simulations. Until recently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) was limited to narrow intelligence and supervised “learning” such as automated cephalometric point recognition, segmentation of teeth from 3D files, and staging of orthodontic treatment. The next step will be to create neural networks based on general intelligence (the human intelligence is considered general intelligence), where the network using powerful computers and complex algorithms will “learn” orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning to suggest the most appropriate treatment plan for optimized treatments and more predictable outcomes. The objectives of this paper are to describe the state of the art in AI and orthodontics and explore potential avenues for future developments and applications. © 2021 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of APOS Trends in Orthodontics.

AB  - A recent report from the European Sleep Research Society’s task force “Beyond AHI” discussed an issue that has been a long-term subject of debate – what are the best metrics for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) diagnosis and treatment outcome assessments? In a similar way, sleep bruxism (SB) metrics have also been a recurrent issue for >30 years and there is still uncertainty in dentistry regarding their optimisation and clinical relevance. SB can occur alone or with comorbidities such as OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, insomnia, headache, orofacial pain, periodic limb movement, rapid eye movement behaviour disorder, and sleep epilepsy. Classically, the diagnosis of SB is based on the patient’s dental and medical history and clinical manifestations; electromyography is used in research and for complex cases. The emergence of new technologies, such as sensors and artificial intelligence, has opened new opportunities. The main objective of the present review is to stimulate the creation of a collaborative taskforce on SB metrics. Several examples are available in sleep medicine. The development of more homogenised metrics could improve the accuracy and refinement of SB assessment, while moving forward toward a personalised approach. It is time to develop SB metrics that are relevant to clinical outcomes and benefit patients who suffer from one or more possible negative consequences of SB. © 2021 European Sleep Research Society

AB  - The accurate and reproducible localization of cephalometric landmarks is an important procedure for treatment planning and clinical practice in orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery. In this paper, we propose a new multistage cephalometric landmark localization method that exploits local appearances and global characteristics simultaneously. To be precise, a convolutional neural network(CNN) is trained by minimizing the sum of all landmark errors. Since landmarks are considered simultaneously, global hard/soft tissue characteristics, as well as landmark relations, can be reflected in this stage. Then, we exploit local appearances by using high-resolution cropped images. In this second stage, we train CNNs for individual landmarks, respectively. Finally, we improve the localization performance of cephalometric landmarks of the mandible with linear estimators. Experiments on ISBI2015 dataset have shown that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods. Also, the proposed method allows us to evaluate confidence (e.g., standard deviational ellipses) due to its probabilistic formulation.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a deep learning-based metal artifact reduction (DL-MAR) method using unpaired data and to evaluate its dosimetric impact in head and neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with the water density override method. Methods: The data set comprised the data of 107 patients who underwent radiotherapy. Fifteen patients with dental fillings were used as the test data set. The computed tomography (CT) images of the remaining 92 patients were divided into two domains: the metal artifact and artifact-free domains. CycleGAN was used for domain translation. The artifact index of the DL-MAR images was compared with that of the original uncorrected (UC) CT images. The dose distributions of the DL-MAR and UC plans were created by comparing the reference clinical plan with the water density override method (water plan) in each dataset. Dosimetric deviation in the oral cavity from the water plan was evaluated. Results: The artifact index of the DL-MAR images was significantly smaller than that of the UC images in all patients (13.2 ± 4.3 vs. 267.3 ± 113.7). Compared with the reference water plan, dose differences of the UC plans were greater than those of the DL-MAR plans. DL-MAR images provided dosimetric results that were more similar to those of the water plan than the UC plan. Conclusions: We developed a fast DL-MAR method using CycleGAN for head and neck IMRT. The proposed method could provide consistent dose calculation against metal artifact and improve the efficiency of the planning process by eliminating manual delineation. © 2020 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica

AB  - Radiomics is an emerging field in radiology that utilizes advanced statistical data characterizing algorithms to evaluate medical imaging and objectively quantify characteristics of a given disease. Due to morphologic heterogeneity and genetic variation intrinsic to neoplasms, radiomics have the potential to provide a unique insight into the underlying tumor and tumor microenvironment. Radiomics has been gaining popularity due to potential applications in disease quantification, predictive modeling, treatment planning, and response assessment – paving way for the advancement of personalized medicine. However, producing a reliable radiomic model requires careful evaluation and construction to be translated into clinical practices that have varying software and/or medical equipment. We aim to review the diagnostic utility of radiomics in otorhinolaryngology, including both cancers of the head and neck as well as the thyroid. © Copyright © 2021 Gul, Bonjoc, Gorlin, Wong, Salem, La, Filippov, Chaudhry, Imam and Chaudhry.

AB  - Determining optimal target tooth arrangements is a key step of treatment planning in digital orthodontics. Existing practice for specifying the target tooth arrangement involves tedious manual operations with the outcome quality depending heavily on the experience of individual specialists, leading to inefficiency and undesirable variations in treatment results. In this work, we proposed a learning-based method for fast and automatic tooth arrangement. To achieve this, we formulate the tooth arrangement task as a novel structured 6-DOF pose prediction problem and solve it by proposing a new neural network architecture to learn from a large set of clinical data that encode successful orthodontic treatment cases. Our method has been validated with extensive experiments and shows promising results both qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objectives: Endodontic treatment works as a successful treatment modality in several cases. However, it may fail due to some reasons unforeseeable by the dentist. Many failures can be prevented by carefully assessing the difficulty level of the case before initiating treatment or by referral to a specialist. This study presents an approach using machine learning to generate an algorithm which can help predict the difficulty level of the case and decide about a referral, with the help of the standard American Association of Endodontists (AAE) Endodontic Case Difficulty Assessment Form. Materials and methods: Using the AAE Endodontic Case Difficulty Form after obtaining the patients’ consent, 500 potential root canal patients were diagnosed. The filled forms were assessed by two pre-calibrated endodontists, and, in cases of conflicting opinion, a third endodontist’s opinion was taken. Artificial neural network was used for generating the algorithm. Results: Using 500 filled AAE forms, a sensitivity of 94.96% was achieved by the machine learning algorithm. Conclusion: This study provides an option for automation to the conventional method of predicting the difficulty level of a case, thus increasing the speed of decision-making and referrals if necessary. Clinical relevance: An AAE Endodontic Case Difficulty Assessment Form when utilized along with machine learning can assist general dentists in rapid assessment of the case difficulty. This is a helpful tool in developing countries, where endodontic treatment and referral guidelines are often neglected. It also helps to make difficulty level assessments easier for novice practitioners, when they are in doubt about the same. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND Root canal retreatment is common after root canal therapy in clinical situations. Especially, completing the retreatment of variant root canals can be challenging. This is particularly true for the molars located at the end of the dental arch. However, advancements in digital dental diagnosis and treatment techniques can solve these problems. Here, we describe a case of a maxillary second molar with a variant distobuccal root canal treated via a novel “inlay-guided endodontics” technique based on improved computer-generated programs. CASE SUMMARY A 63-year-old man complained of a defect in the maxillary left second molar. The tooth, diagnosed with post-treatment endodontic disease, was initially treated by conventional methods, which were ineffective. Our “inlay-guided endodontics” technique was subsequently adopted, with the establishment of a precise integrated three-dimensional (3D) plate model of cone-beam computed tomography data and a digital impression of the dentition. An optimal root canal approach was generated for the “virtual file” in the 3D model. The plate data were imported into a 3D printer and printed. With the help of the guide plate, the file was accurately placed into the cervical third of the distal root canal. The root canal and prosthodontic treatments successfully proceeded subsequently. CONCLUSION Our newly developed inlay guide plates may facilitate individualized and minimally invasive root canal treatment. © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB  - The head and neck (H&N) region is frequently replanned during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT), but replanning disrupts clinical workflow and presents additional burden on patients. The purpose of this study was to establish a standard treatment planning approach to minimize H&N replanning by identifying a correlation between dosimetric variables and replan frequency. In a retrospective study of 27 bilateral oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with IMPT at a single institution, cases were evaluated using Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression for a significant relationship between replan frequency and the following variables: beam number, clinical target volume (CTV) coverage, presence of dental fillings, and robustness. The reason and timing for replan initiation, and patient immobilization was also recorded to identify trends. Results suggested that beam number, CTV coverage, presence of dental fillings, and the initial robustness curve on the high-dose CTV did not individually contribute to replanning frequency. Setup variation in the soft tissue of the neck was the most prominent reason for replanning. A lack of correlation between the number of replans and the studied dosimetric variables highlights the necessity of verification CT and adaptive replanning in IMPT of H&N cancer. Departments may therefore benefit from a methodical replan workflow. One development showing potential to enhance clinical replan processes is machine learning-based automatic adaptive replanning. © 2020 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists

AB  - Orthodontic science has progressed tremendously in the last two decades, from traditional stainless wires and brackets to sophisticated contemporary materials, types of brackets and bonding agents, anchorage devices and the use of nanotechnology. The development has extended to all domains of diagnosis, treatment planning, treatment alternatives, storage of data, patient education and marketing. This chapter comprehensively lists all spheres of advancements, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each of the enumerated processes. Digitization in orthodontics has completely revolutionized diagnosis, employing three-dimensional (3D) analysis by intraoral scans, 3D-Cone Beam Computed Tomography (3D-CBCT) radiographs and stereophotogrammetry, for greater accuracy and possibility of virtual setting. In addition, aligner technology has also seen a boom using this virtual data for computer aided design(CAD) and creation of appliances by 3D printing. Varied softwares have found their way into orthodontic office for analysis, superimpositions and predictions, thus allowing the patients to make informed decisions. Few softwares also allow remote patient monitoring, tele-orthodontics, patient education and reminder applications. Social media has become a powerful tool for product awareness, discussions with patients, orthodontic teaching, though the accuracy of information is questionable. Acceleration of orthodontic treatment has been targeted with various surgical (micro-osteoperforation, corticotomy, Wilckodontics etc.), non-surgical (vibration, lasers etc.) and biological (prostaglandins etc.) agents. This chapter also touches upon upcoming areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data in orthodontics which can aid in evidence-based practice from large clinical repositories in cost effective ways. Current COVID-19 times brings forth the importance of virtual patient data and minimal patient contact, thus emphasizing the role of modified orthodontic triage, a significant mention of which has been made in the current chapter. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Panoramic radiographs, also known as orthopantomograms, are routinely used in most dental clinics. However, it has been difficult to develop an automated method that detects the various structures present in these radiographs. One of the main reasons for this is that structures of various sizes and shapes are collectively shown in the image. In order to solve this problem, the recently proposed concept of panoptic segmentation, which integrates instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, was applied to panoramic radiographs. A state-of-the-art deep neural network model designed for panoptic segmentation was trained to segment the maxillary sinus, maxilla, mandible, mandibular canal, normal teeth, treated teeth, and dental implants on panoramic radiographs. Unlike conventional semantic segmentation, each object in the tooth and implant classes was individually classified. For evaluation, the panoptic quality, segmentation quality, recognition quality, intersection over union (IoU), and instance-level IoU were calculated. The evaluation and visualization results showed that the deep learning-based artificial intelligence model can perform panoptic segmentation of images, including those of the maxillary sinus and mandibular canal, on panoramic radiographs. This automatic machine learning method might assist dental practitioners to set up treatment plans and diagnose oral and maxillofacial diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The human masticatory system is a complex functional unit characterized by a multitude of skeletal components, muscles, soft tissues, and teeth. Muscle activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects. © Copyright © 2020 Abdi, Sagl, Srungarapu, Stavness, Prisman, Abolmaesumi and Fels.

AB  - Objectives: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization. Several problems are associated with AI: hypersensitivity, wear, restorations requiring replacement, gingivitis, aesthetic problems, and social avoidance. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of crown therapy in young individuals with AI showing excellent results. This study reports results from a long-term-follow-up with focus on quality, longevity and adverse events. Methods: The RCT included 27 patients (aged 11–22 years) with severe AI in need of crown therapy and used a split-mouth technique. After placing 119 Procera® crowns and 108 IPS e.max Press crowns following randomization, we assessed longevity, quality, adverse events, and tooth sensitivity and calculated survival rates and success rates. Results: We followed the original 227 crowns for 4.3–7.4 years (mean 5.5 ± 0.8). In all, 79% (193) crowns were followed for at least 5 years. The survival rate was 99.6% and the success rate, 94.7%; 95% of the crowns had excellent or acceptable quality. Due to suboptimal marginal integrity, 4% of the crowns required adjustment. Sensitivity problems decreased after crown therapy (p < 0.001). All adverse events occurred in patients aged 19–23 years and involved apical periodontitis (3% of teeth); all but two events were related to dental trauma in the actual tooth. Conclusions: Ceramic crown therapy in adolescents and young adults with severe forms of AI show excellent survival and success rates and longevity with few adverse events. Clinical significance: Ceramic crown therapy can be recommended for adolescents and young adults with severe forms of amelogenesis imperfecta. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been applied to implant dentistry. The increasing use of this technology produces a critical number of images that can be used for training artificial intelligence (AI). Objectives: To investigate the learning curve of the developed AI for dental implant planning in the posterior maxillary region. Methods: A total of 184 CBCT image sets of patients receiving posterior maxillary implants were processed with software (DentiPlan Pro version 3.7; NECTEC, NSTDA, Thailand) to acquire 316 implant position images. The planning software image interfaces were anonymously captured with full‐screen resolution. Three hundred images were randomly sorted to create six data sets, including 1–50, 1–100, 1–150, 1–200, 1–250, and 1–300. The data sets were used to develop AI for dental implant planning through the IBM PowerAI Vision platform (IBM Thailand Co., Ltd., Thailand) by using a faster R‐CNN algorithm. Four data augmentation algorithms, including blur, sharpen, color, and noise, were also integrated to observe the improvement of the model. After the testing process with 16 images that were not included in the training set, the recorded data were analyzed for detection and accuracy to generate the learning curve of the model. Results: The learning curve revealed some similar patterns. The curve trend of the original and blurred augmented models was in a similar pattern in the panoramic image. In the last training set, the blurred augmented model improved the detection by 12.50%, but showed less accuracy than the original model by 18.34%, whereas the other three augmented models had different patterns. They were continuously increasing in both detection and accuracy. However, their detection dropped in the last training set. The colored augmented model demonstrated the best improvement with 40% for the panoramic image and 18.59% for the cross-sectional image. Conclusion: Within the limitation of the study, it may be concluded that the number of images used in AI development is positively related to the AI interpretation. The data augmentation techniques to improve the ability of AI are still questionable. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective: Evidence suggests that the medication lists of patients are often incomplete and could negatively affect patient outcomes. In this article, the authors propose the application of collaborative filtering methods to the medication reconciliation task. Given a current medication list for a patient, the authors employ collaborative filtering approaches to predict drugs the patient could be taking but are missing from their observed list. Design: The collaborative filtering approach presented in this paper emerges from the insight that an omission in a medication list is analogous to an item a consumer might purchase from a product list. Online retailers use collaborative filtering to recommend relevant products using retrospective purchase data. In this article, the authors argue that patient information in electronic medical records, combined with artificial intelligence methods, can enhance medication reconciliation. The authors formulate the detection of omissions in medication lists as a collaborative filtering problem. Detection of omissions is accomplished using several machine-learning approaches. The effectiveness of these approaches is evaluated using medication data from three long-term care centers. The authors also propose several decision-theoretic extensions to the methodology for incorporating medical knowledge into recommendations. Results: Results show that collaborative filtering identifies the missing drug in the top-10 list about 40e50% of the time and the therapeutic class of the missing drug 50%e65% of the time at the three clinics in this study. Conclusion: Results suggest that collaborative filtering can be a valuable tool for reconciling medication lists, complementing currently recommended process-driven approaches. However, a one-size-fits-all approach is not optimal, and consideration should be given to context (eg, types of patients and drug regimens) and consequence (eg, the impact of omission on outcomes).

AB  - This paper introduced a newly developed method to acquire three-dimensional data from serial two-dimensional images of a dental cast. The system consists of a computer and a set of data acquiring device. The data acquiring device is used to take serial pictures of the a dental cast; an artificial neural network works to translate two-dimensional pictures to three-dimensional data; then three-dimensional image can reconstruct by the computer. The three-dimensional data acquiring of dental casts is the foundation of computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics.

AB  - Accurate tooth segmentation on a 3D dental mesh model is a vital task in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies for orthodontic treatment planning. This task is especially challenging due to the complexity and variation of human teeth. Recently, several pioneering deep neural networks (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the computer vision and computer graphics communities to efficiently segment 3D objects in an end-to-end manner. However, these methods do not perform well and produce undesirable results in the specific task of tooth labeling because they cannot explicitly model the fine-grained local geometric context of teeth. In this chapter, we comprehensively review a recently-proposed deep neural network, MeshSegNet or MeshSNet, which is designed for end-to-end tooth segmentation on 3D dental surface meshes captured from intraoral scanners. The entire approach from preprocessing to postprocessing for the task-automated tooth segmentation is discussed in detail. The preprocessing procedures of the MeshSegNet include mesh simplification and data augmentation. The results from MeshSegNet are then refined in two stages during the post-processing phase. Each of these steps is detailed in this chapter, along with a comparison of segmentation results between the original PointNet and MeshSegNet, which highlights the superior performance of MeshSegNet. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Accurate segmentation of the jaw (i.e., mandible and maxilla) and the teeth in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is essential for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Although various (semi)automated methods have been proposed to segment the jaw or the teeth, there is still a lack of fully automated segmentation methods that can simultaneously segment both anatomic structures in CBCT scans (i.e., multiclass segmentation). In this study, we aimed to train and validate a mixed-scale dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network for multiclass segmentation of the jaw, the teeth, and the background in CBCT scans. Thirty CBCT scans were obtained from patients who had undergone orthodontic treatment. Gold standard segmentation labels were manually created by 4 dentists. As a benchmark, we also evaluated MS-D networks that segmented the jaw or the teeth (i.e., binary segmentation). All segmented CBCT scans were converted to virtual 3-dimensional (3D) models. The segmentation performance of all trained MS-D networks was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient and surface deviation. The CBCT scans segmented by the MS-D network demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentations (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.934 ± 0.019, jaw; 0.945 ± 0.021, teeth). The MS-D network–based 3D models of the jaw and the teeth showed minor surface deviations when compared with the corresponding gold standard 3D models (0.390 ± 0.093 mm, jaw; 0.204 ± 0.061 mm, teeth). The MS-D network took approximately 25 s to segment 1 CBCT scan, whereas manual segmentation took about 5 h. This study showed that multiclass segmentation of jaw and teeth was accurate and its performance was comparable to binary segmentation. The MS-D network trained for multiclass segmentation would therefore make patient-specific orthodontic treatment more feasible by strongly reducing the time required to segment multiple anatomic structures in CBCT scans. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2021.

AB  - Dental impression tray is frequently used in dentistry to record the patient's oral structure for clinical oral diagnosis and treatment planning. Manual procedure of taking impressions is costly, time-consuming, and additionally, no research has been done on selecting dental impression tray from dental arch images using computer vision in real-life scenarios. In this spirit, an intelligent model is proposed based on computer vision and machine learning to select appropriate dental impression trays from maxillary arch images. A dataset of 52 patients' maxillary arch images have been acquired and various sets of features such as colors, textures, and shapes of the images were extracted to better characterize the maxillary arch images. Considering the importance of the features in describing the maxillary arch object and to improve the classification performance, a method based on multi-feature fusion with ensemble classifier is proposed. Besides, the performance of a deep learning based multilayer perceptron neural network is also investigated. The proposed multi-feature fusion with ensemble classifier attained 92.31% precision, 91.75% recall, 91.75% accuracy, respectively, on the dataset, which clearly establishes the feasibility of the proposed model. An illustration of a real-life application of the proposed model is also provided.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Craniofacial growths and developments play an important role in treatment planning of orthopedics and orthodontics. Traditional growth studies are mainly on longitudinal growth datasets of 2D lateral cephalometric radiographs (LCR). In this paper, we propose a temporal consistent 2D-3D registration technique enabling 3D growth measurements of craniofacial structures. We initialize the independent 2D-3D registration by the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regression, which produces the dense displacement field of the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image when given the LCR. The temporal constraints of the growth-stable structures are used to refine the 2D-3D registration. Instead of traditional independent 2D-3D registration, we jointly solve the nonrigid displacement fields of a series of input LCRs captured at different ages. The hierarchical pyramid of the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) is introduced to fasten the convergence. The proposed method has been applied to the growth dataset in clinical orthodontics. The resulted 2D-3D registration is consistent with both the input LCRs concerning the structural contours and the 3D volumetric images regarding the growth-stable structures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - The biggest challenge restorative dentists face in rehabilitating patients with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is trying to restore aesthetics, function and occlusal stability while keeping the treatment as conservative as possible. The goals of treatment should be to prolong the life of the patient's own teeth and avoid or delay the need for extractions and subsequent replacement with conventional fixed, removable or implant retained prostheses. In order to achieve these goals a stepwise approach to treatment planning is required starting with the most conservative but aesthetically acceptable treatment. This article discusses the management of AI and presents the various treatment options available for restoring the adult patient who presents to the dentist with AI.

AB  - Cephalometric analysis is a fundamental examination which is widely used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Its key step is to detect the anatomical landmarks in lateral cephalograms, which is time-consuming in traditional manual way. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach with a cascaded three-stage convolutional neural networks to predict cephalometric landmarks automatically. In the first stage, high-level features of the craniofacial structures are extracted to locate the lateral face area which helps to overcome the appearance variations. Next, we process the aligned face area to estimate the locations of all landmarks simultaneously. At the last stage, each landmark is refined through a dedicated network using high-resolution image data around the initial position to achieve more accurate result. We evaluate the proposed method on several anatomical landmark datasets and the experimental results show that our method achieved competitive performance compared with the other methods. © 2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic segmentation of individual tooth root is a key technology for the reconstruction of the three-dimensional dental model from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images, which is of great significance for the orthodontic, implant and other dental diagnosis and treatment planning. OBJECTIVES: Currently, tooth root segmentation is mainly done manually because of the similar gray of the tooth root and the alveolar bone from CBCT images. This study aims to explore the automatic tooth root segmentation algorithm of CBCT axial image sequence based on deep learning. METHODS: We proposed a new automatic tooth root segmentation method based on the deep learning U-net with AGs. Since CBCT sequence has a strong correlation between adjacent slices, a Recurrent neural network (RNN) was applied to extract the intra-slice and inter-slice contexts. To develop and test this new method for automatic segmentation of tooth roots using CBCT images, 24 sets of CBCT sequences containing 1160 images and 5 sets of CBCT sequences containing 361 images were used to train and test the network, respectively. RESULTS: Applying to the testing dataset, the segmentation accuracy measured by the intersection over union (IOU), dice similarity coefficient (DICE), average precision rate (APR), average recall rate (ARR), and average symmetrical surface distance (ASSD) are 0.914, 0.955, 95.8% , 95.3% , 0.145 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that the new method combining attention U-net with RNN yields the promising results of automatic tooth roots segmentation, which has potential to help improve the segmentation efficiency and accuracy in future clinical practice. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Accurate tooth labeling on 3D dental surfaces is a vital task in computer-aided orthodontic treatment planning. Existing automated or semi-automated methods usually require human interactions, which is time-consuming. Also, they typically use simple geometric properties as the criteria for segmentation, which cannot well handle the high variation of tooth appearance across different patients. Recently, several pioneering deep neural networks (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the computer vision and computer graphics communities to efficiently segment 3D shapes in an end-to-end manner. However, these methods do not perform well in our specific task of tooth labeling, especially considering that they cannot explicitly model fine-grained local geometric context of teeth (although only a small portion of dental surfaces but with different shapes and appearances). In this paper, we propose a specific deep neural network (called MeshSNet) for end-to-end tooth segmentation on 3D dental surfaces captured by advanced intraoral scanners. Using directly raw mesh data as input, our MeshSNet adopts novel graph-constrained learning modules to hierarchically extract multi-scale contextual features, and then densely integrates local-to-global geometric features to comprehensively characterize mesh cells for the segmentation task. We evaluated our proposed method on an in-house clinic dataset via 3-fold cross-validation. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our MeshSNet method, compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 3D shape segmentation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The increasing storage of information, data, and forms of knowledge has led to the development of new technologies that can help to accomplish complex tasks in different areas, such as in dentistry. In this context, the role of computational methods, such as radiomics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, has been progressing remarkably for dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR). These tools bring new perspectives for diagnosis, classification, and prediction of oral diseases, treatment planning, and for the evaluation and prediction of outcomes, minimizing the possibilities of human errors. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of using radiomics and machine learning (ML) for imaging in oral healthcare is presented in this paper. Although the number of published studies is still relatively low, the preliminary results are very promising and in a near future, an augmented dentomaxillofacial radiology (ADMFR) will combine the use of radiomics-based and AI-based analyses with the radiologist's evaluation. In addition to the opportunities and possibilities, some challenges and limitations have also been discussed for further investigations. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Caries is a dental disease caused by bacterial infection. If the cause of the caries is detected early, the treatment will be relatively easy, which in turn prevents caries from spreading. The current common procedure of dentists is to first perform radiographic examination on the patient and mark the lesions manually. However, the work of judging lesions and markings requires professional experience and is very time-consuming and repetitive. Taking advantage of the rapid development of artificial intelligence imaging research and technical methods will help dentists make accurate markings and improve medical treatments. It can also shorten the judgment time of professionals. In addition to the use of Gaussian high-pass filter and Otsu's threshold image enhancement technology, this research solves the problem that the original cutting technology cannot extract certain single teeth, and it proposes a caries and lesions area analysis model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can identify caries and restorations from the bitewing images. Moreover, it provides dentists with more accurate objective judgment data to achieve the purpose of automatic diagnosis and treatment planning as a technology for assisting precision medicine. A standardized database established following a defined set of steps is also proposed in this study. There are three main steps to generate the image of a single tooth from a bitewing image, which can increase the accuracy of the analysis model. The steps include (1) preprocessing of the dental image to obtain a high-quality binarization, (2) a dental image cropping procedure to obtain individually separated tooth samples, and (3) a dental image masking step which masks the fine broken teeth from the sample and enhances the quality of the training. Among the current four common neural networks, namely, AlexNet, GoogleNet, Vgg19, and ResNet50, experimental results show that the proposed AlexNet model in this study for restoration and caries judgments has an accuracy as high as 95.56% and 90.30%, respectively. These are promising results that lead to the possibility of developing an automatic judgment method of bitewing film.

AB  - In this paper, a new powerful deep learning framework, named as DENTECT, is developed in order to instantly detect five different dental treatment approaches and simultaneously number the dentition based on the FDI notation on panoramic X-ray images. This makes DENTECT the first system that focuses on identification of multiple dental treatments; namely periapical lesion therapy, fillings, root canal treatment (RCT), surgical extraction, and conventional extraction all of which are accurately located within their corresponding borders and tooth numbers. Although DENTECT is trained on only 1005 images, the annotations supplied by experts provide satisfactory results for both treatment and enumeration detection. This framework carries out enumeration with an average precision (AP) score of 89.4% and performs treatment identification with a 59.0% AP score. Clinically, DENTECT is a practical and adoptable tool that accelerates the process of treatment planning with a level of accuracy which could compete with that of dental clinicians. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - 3D imaging and 3D printing are two methods that have been proven very useful in medicine. The objective of 3D medical imaging is to recreate the static and functional anatomy of the inner body. The development of computational systems for image processing and multidimensional monitoring of medical data is important for diagnosis and treatment planning. The technique of 3D printing has enabled the materialization of anatomical models and surgical splints using medical imaging data. The methods of 3D imaging and 3D printing have been utilized in various medical fields such as neuroimaging, neurosurgery, dentistry, otolaryngology and facial plastic surgery. This review aims to evaluate the use of 3D imaging and 3D printing techniques in head and neck surgery and concludes that these technologies have revolutionized medicine. However, improvements in healthcare systems and further research still have to be made to establish their use in everyday medical practices. Copyright © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - One of the main goals of dental treatment is to mimic teeth and design smiles in a most natural and aesthetic manner, based on the individual and specific needs of the patient. Possibilities to reach that goal have significantly improved over the last decade through new and specific treatment modalities, steadily enhanced and more aesthetic dental materials, and novel techniques and technologies. This article gives an overview of the evolution of aesthetic dentistry over the past 100 y from a historical point of view and highlights advances in the development of dental research and clinical interventions that have contributed the science and art of aesthetic dentistry. Among the most noteworthy advancements over the past decade are the establishment of universal aesthetic rules and guidelines based on the assessment of natural aesthetic parameters, anatomy, and physiognomy; the development of tooth whitening and advanced restorative as well as prosthetic materials and techniques, supported by the pioneering discovery of dental adhesion; the significant progress in orthodontics and periodontal as well as oral and maxillofacial surgery; and, most recently, the implementation of digital technologies in the 3-dimensional planning and realization of truly natural, individual, and aesthetic smiles. In the future, artificial intelligence and machine learning will likely lead to automation of aesthetic evaluation, smile design, and treatment-planning processes. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2019.

AB  - In this study, multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks are used to predict orthodontic treatment plans, including the determination of extraction-nonextraction, extraction patterns, and anchorage patterns. The neural network can output the feasibilities of several applicable treatment plans, offering orthodontists flexibility in making decisions. The neural network models show an accuracy of 94.0% for extraction-nonextraction prediction, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.982, a sensitivity of 94.6%, and a specificity of 93.8%. The accuracies of the extraction patterns and anchorage patterns are 84.2% and 92.8%, respectively. The most important features for prediction of the neural networks are “crowding, upper arch” “ANB” and “curve of Spee”. For handling discrete input features with missing data, the average value method has a better complement performance than the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method; for handling continuous features with missing data, k-NN performs better than the other methods most of the time. These results indicate that the proposed method based on artificial neural networks can provide good guidance for orthodontic treatment planning for less-experienced orthodontists. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Children with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) experience many oral difficulties including sensitivity and aesthetics. The methods of treating AI children are limited and therefore a program of care was evaluated in order to assess the clinical efficacy of providing preventive and restorative treatments. A non-randomised convenience sample of 12 patients with AI was evaluated. A comprehensive patient history was recorded, followed by a clinical and radiographic assessment of oral health. In 8/12 patients a hypoplastic form of AI was diagnosed, in 2/12 cases hypomaturation and in 2/12 cases hypocalcified form were noted. Chief complaints were mainly related to unsatisfactory aesthetics and dental sensitivity. In 8 patients there was active dental caries. Most of the patients had gingivitis and showed fair oral hygiene. The presence of non-enamel dental anomalies was recorded in 9 patients. All patients received meticulous preventive care. Initial treatment depended on AI type and oral health of the patient. During the transition period, both conventional and resin modified glassionomer cements, as well as composite resin materials, were used to restore posterior teeth. Direct composite resin restorations were used to improve the appearance of anterior teeth. In 4 patients a long-lasting interdisciplinary approach including orthodontics, metal-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures, and direct composite restorations was required. FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up periods varied between 2-11 years. All children have been regularly recalled at 3 monthly intervals. Caries prevalence has remained low during the follow-up postoperative period and patients have reported satisfaction with the treatment they have received. AI is associated with multiple non-enamel anomalies and requires a complex treatment. Treatment planning is related to the age of the patient, the type and severity of the disorder, and the oral health of the patient. Early diagnosis, preventive care and timely treatment are of foremost importance to improve oral health in children with AI.

AB  - The increasing use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques in dental medicine has boosted the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for various clinical problems. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral/facial scans are potential sources of image data to develop 3D image-based AI systems for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and prediction of treatment outcome. This review focuses on current developments and performance of AI for 3D imaging in dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR) as well as intraoral and facial scanning. In DMFR, machine learning-based algorithms proposed in the literature focus on three main applications, including automated diagnosis of dental and maxillofacial diseases, localization of anatomical landmarks for orthodontic and orthognathic treatment planning, and general improvement of image quality. Automatic recognition of teeth and diagnosis of facial deformations using AI systems based on intraoral and facial scanning will very likely be a field of increased interest in the future. The review is aimed at providing dental practitioners and interested colleagues in healthcare with a comprehensive understanding of the current trend of AI developments in the field of 3D imaging in dental medicine. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The orthodontic cephalometry which forms a quintessential radiographic examination provides a valuable diagnostic resource for everyday orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. The method of analyzing the lateral cephalometric radiograph (LCR) has been found to lack effective methods of landmark identification and objective validation. This drawback, with the use of augmented reality (AR) for 3D visualization and machine learning for objective validation, can be effectively incorporated into the learning of cephalometrics. The two technologies together can produce a learning platform by reducing subjective errors and its implications on treatment planning in addition to effectively eliminating dissonance in learning. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduced our newly developed method to acquire three-dimensional images of a dental cast. A rotatable table, a laser-knife, a mirror, a CCD camera and a personal computer made up of a three-dimensional data acquiring system. A dental cast is placed on the table; the mirror is installed beside the table; a linear laser is projected to the dental cast; the CCD camera is put up above the dental cast, it can take picture of the dental cast and the shadow in the mirror; while the table rotating, the camera records the shape of the laser streak projected on the dental cast, and transmit the data to the computer. After the table rotated one circuit, the computer processes the data, calculates the three-dimensional coordinates of the dental cast's surface. In data processing procedure, artificial neural networks are enrolled to calibrate the lens distortion, map coordinates form screen coordinate system to world coordinate system. According to the three-dimensional coordinates, the computer reconstructs the stereo image of the dental cast. It is essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics. In comparison with other systems in service, for example, laser beam three-dimensional scanning system, the characteristic of this three-dimensional data acquiring system: a. celerity, it casts only 1 minute to scan a dental cast; b. compact, the machinery is simple and compact; c. no blind zone, a mirror is introduced ably to reduce blind zone.

AB  - Objective: To perform a comprehensive review of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in dentistry, providing the community with a broad insight on the different advances that these technologies and tools have produced, paying special attention to the area of esthetic dentistry and color research. Materials and methods: The comprehensive review was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, for papers published in English language in the last 20 years. Results: Out of 3871 eligible papers, 120 were included for final appraisal. Study methodologies included deep learning (DL; n = 76), fuzzy logic (FL; n = 12), and other ML techniques (n = 32), which were mainly applied to disease identification, image segmentation, image correction, and biomimetic color analysis and modeling. Conclusions: The insight provided by the present work has reported outstanding results in the design of high-performance decision support systems for the aforementioned areas. The future of digital dentistry goes through the design of integrated approaches providing personalized treatments to patients. In addition, esthetic dentistry can benefit from those advances by developing models allowing a complete characterization of tooth color, enhancing the accuracy of dental restorations. Clinical significance: The use of AI and ML has an increasing impact on the dental profession and is complementing the development of digital technologies and tools, with a wide application in treatment planning and esthetic dentistry procedures. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Orthodontic malocclusion treatment is a procedure to correct dental and facial morphology by moving teeth or adjusting underlying bones. It concentrates on two key aspects: the treatment planning for dentition alignment; and the plan implementation with the aid of external forces. Existing treatment planning requires significant time and effort for orthodontists and technicians. At present, no work successfully automates the process of tooth movement in orthodontics. In this study, we leverage state-of-the-art deep learning methods and propose an automated treatment planning process to take advantage of the spatial interrelationship between different teeth. Our method enables to exploit a 3-dimensional spatial transformation architecture for malocclusion treatment planning with 4 steps: (1) sub-sampling the dentition point cloud to get a critical point set; (2) extracting local features for each tooth and global features for the whole dentition; (3) obtaining transformation parameters conditioned on the features refined from the combination of both the local and global features and, (4) transforming initial dentition point cloud to the parameter-defined final state. Our approach achieves 84.5% cosine similarity accuracy (CSA) for the transformation matrix in the non-augmented dataset, and 95.3% maximum CSA for the augmented dataset. Our approach’s outcome is proven to be effective in quantitative analysis and semantically reasonable in qualitative analysis. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) is a syndromic entity comprising several clinical conditions, mostly genetic-based, affecting quality and quantity of enamel. The use of digital tools can be advantageous to enhance communication between the dental team and patients. Moreover, a full digital approach would allow to check each single clinical step according to the treatment plan with a backward approach. The aim of this case report is to describe a multidisciplinary treatment program of a young patient with severe open bite and amelogenesis imperfecta, whose restorative rehabilitation was planned in a full-digital workflow, from the initial communication phase up to the final prosthodontic rehabilitation. Case report An 8-year old female patient was diagnosed with a Class II division 1 malocclusion, severe open bite and AI. The treatment plan included 3 phases: the elimination of the tongue interposition habit and the anterior open bite, the orthodontic correction of dental deviation and leveling of both dental arches and a prosthetic rehabilitation. The extraction of the four first molars corrected the canine and molar Angle Class II relationships, deviation of the midline and repositioning of the maxillary incisors on the sagittal plane. Feldspathic ceramics was used in anterior sites to enhance the esthetic outcome. CAD/CAM hybrid ceramo-polymeric restorative material (PICN) was chosen for posterior regions. Conclusion The outcomes of the present case report proved that the planned objectives were satisfactorily obtained thanks to proper treatment planning, full digital workflow and the patient’s optimal compliance with the extraoral device. © 2021 Ariesdue.

AB  - Despite the rapid improvement in dental health over the last few decades, a significant portion of our population continue seek dental care every year. Estimates show that 13% of adults seek dental care for dental infection or fatigue within four years. The Social and individual burden of this disease can be reduced by its early detection. However, the symptoms of teeth infection in the early stages are not clear, hence, it would be relatively difficult to predict teeth infections based solely on human skills and experience. Big Data (BD) technologies have a great potential in transforming dental care, as they have revolutionized other industries. In addition to reducing cost, they could save millions of lives and improve patient outcomes. This paper proposes a novel integrated prediction model that extracts hidden knowledge from radiographic datasets containing a large volume of dental X-ray images and utilizes this knowledge to predict dental infections. Initially, preprocessing techniques using morphological skeleton and mean approach is applied to eliminate noise and enhance the images. Next, Multi Scale Segmented Region (MSR) approach, Watershed Approach (WA), Sobel edge Detection (SD), Histogram based Segmentation (HS), Trainable Segmentation (TS), Dual Clustering (DC), and Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) are examined for image segmentation and feature extraction. Among these methods, MSR was selected for feature extraction since it outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, precision, recall and F1-score. Then, a set of neural network classifiers are trained to identify patterns in the extracted optimized features and predict dental infections. For this purpose, we have examined Bacterial Optimized Recurrent Neural Networks (BORNN), Deep Learning Neural Networks (DANN), Genetic Optimized Neural Networks (GONN) and Adaptive Neural Networks Algorithm (ADNN). BORNN have shown maximum accuracy and Roc value (98.1% and 0.92 respectively), and minimum error values (MSE = 0.189, MAE = 0.143). The output of the proposed integrated prediction model is fed into a dental robot who proceeds with the treatment process with high accuracy and minimum delay. The proposed prediction model was implemented using a big data analytics tool called Apache SAMOA and experimental results showed its correctness and effectiveness. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Odontogenic cysts originate from remnants of the tooth forming epithelium in the jaws and gingiva. There are various kinds of such cysts with different biological behaviours that carry different patient risks and require different treatment plans. Types of odontogenic cysts can be distinguished by the properties of their epithelial layers in H&E stained samples. Herein we detail a set of image features for automatically distinguishing between four types of odontogenic cyst in digital micrographs and evaluate their effectiveness using two statistical classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and bagging with logistic regression as the base learner (BLR). Cyst type was correctly predicted from among four classes of odontogenic cysts between 83.8% and 92.3% of the time with an SVM and between 90. ±. 0.92% and 95.4. ±. 1.94% with a BLR. One particular cyst type was associated with the majority of misclassifications. Omission of this cyst type from the data set improved the classification rate for the remaining three cyst types to 96.2% for both SVM and BLR. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cephalometric tracing method is usually used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to automatically detect anatomical landmarks in cephalometric X-ray images. We train the deep encoder-decoder model for landmark detection, which combines global landmark configuration with local high-resolution feature responses. The proposed framework is based on a 2-stage u-net, regressing the multi-channel heatmaps for landmark detection. In this framework, we embed attention mechanism with global stage heatmaps, guiding the local stage inferring, to regress the local heatmap patches in a high resolution. Besides, an Expansive Exploration strategy is applied to improve robustness while inferring, expanding the searching scope without increasing model complexity. We have evaluated the proposed framework in the most widely-used public dataset of landmark detection in cephalometric X-ray images. With less computation and manually tuning, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Decision-support systems hold a specialized body of knowledge in computerized form such that the non- specialist can obtain expert-level information. The goal of these systems in clinical sciences is usually to assist patient care by providing the clinician with improved diagnosis or treatment planning. Decision-support systems consist of three components: the user interface through which the clinician or patient enters signs or symptoms, the set of data describing clinical knowledge in the domain of the program, and an inference engine to manipulate the data set in light of a patient's specific signs or symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis or treatment plan. Such systems usually use one of three mechanisms of analysis alone or in combination: classification trees, Bayesian conditional probabilities, or rule-based (heuristic) systems. Numerous problems must be solved before decision-support systems will become commonplace in clinical practice. Data entry of patients' signs and symptoms is often tedious. The quality of the clinician's initial observations is of great importance in determining the quality of the output. It is also often difficult to convey to a program the subtlety of clinical information observed. Knowledge required in clinical data bases is often unavailable or imprecise. As these and other challenges are addressed we can anticipate increased utility of decision support programs in the future.

AB  - The majority of work on computer use in the dental field has focused on non-clinical practice management information needs. Very few computer-based dental information systems provide management support of the clinical care process, particularly with respect to quality management. Traditional quality assurance methods rely on the paper record and provide only retrospective analysis. Today, proactive quality management initiatives are on the rise. Computer-based dental information systems are being integrated into the care environment, actively providing decision support as patient care is being delivered. These new systems emphasize assessment and improvement of patient care at the time of treatment, thus building internal quality management into the caregiving process. The integration of real time quality management and patient care will be expedited by the introduction of an information system architecture that emulates the gathering and storage of clinical care data currently provided by the paper record. As a proposed solution to the problems associated with existing dental record systems, the computer-based patient record has emerged as a possible alternative to the paper dental record. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently conducted a study on improving the efficiency and accuracy of patient record keeping. As a result of this study, the IOM advocates the development and implementation of computer-based patient records as the standard for all patient care records. This project represents the ongoing efforts of The University of Iowa College of Dentistry's collaboration with the University of Uppsala Data Center, Uppsala, Sweden, on a computer-based patient dental record model. ICOHR (Intelligent Computer Based Oral Health Record) is an information system which brings together five important parts of the patient's dental record: medical and dental history; oral status; treatment planning; progress notes; and a Patient Care Database, generated from their clinical care information (the database is also stored in the ICOHR). ICOHR is designed to be integrated into a traditional practice management system. The components of the ICOHR system support the use of various types of clinical care quality management tools, including medical alerts, clinical care guidelines, care modifiers, and diagnostic decision support. Data input is multimodal, so the user may use both voice recognition and direct input with a digitizer board to enter information into the database. ICOHR is designed to be integrated into the clinical environment in an ergonomic fashion in order to facilitate the unobtrusive and efficient acquisition of patient information. ICOHR is currently under clinical evaluation in both private practice and institutional environments. The private practice is a large general dentistry practice with over twenty sites scattered throughout a large metropolitan area. The institutional settings are a College of Dentistry and a Hospital Dentistry program. The evaluations have started in two of the sites and the other site will be phased in during the next six months. Our demonstration of the system will include both prepared presentations of the system's various functions and provide an opportunity for hands-on use of the system for interested attendees.
