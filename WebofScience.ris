TI  - The role of AI and machine learning in contemporary orthodontics
T2  - APOS TRENDS IN ORTHODONTICS
AB  - In the past 20 years, the orthodontic profession has adopted digital technologies such as computer-assisted tooth movement, automated staged dental aligner production, and 3D simulations. Until recently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) was limited to narrow intelligence and supervised "learning" such as automated cephalometric point recognition, segmentation of teeth from 3D files, and staging of orthodontic treatment. The next step will be to create neural networks based on general intelligence (the human intelligence is considered general intelligence), where the network using powerful computers and complex algorithms will "learn" orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning to suggest the most appropriate treatment plan for optimized treatments and more predictable outcomes. The objectives of this paper are to describe the state of the art in AI and orthodontics and explore potential avenues for future developments and applications.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Orthodontics: Critical Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - With increasing digitalization in orthodontics, certain orthodontic manufacturing processes such as the fabrication of indirect bonding trays, aligner production, or wire bending can be automated. However, orthodontic treatment planning and evaluation remains a specialist's task and responsibility. As the prediction of growth in orthodontic patients and response to orthodontic treatment is inherently complex and individual, orthodontists make use of features gathered from longitudinal, multimodal, and standardized orthodontic data sets. Currently, these data sets are used by the orthodontist to make informed, rule-based treatment decisions. In research, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to assist orthodontists with the extraction of relevant data from such data sets. Here, AI has been applied for the analysis of clinical imagery, such as automated landmark detection in lateral cephalograms but also for evaluation of intraoral scans or photographic data. Furthermore, AI is applied to help orthodontists with decision support for treatment decisions such as the need for orthognathic surgery or for orthodontic tooth extractions. One major challenge in current AI research in orthodontics is the limited generalizability, as most studies use unicentric data with high risks of bias. Moreover, comparing AI across different studies and tasks is virtually impossible as both outcomes and outcome metrics vary widely, and underlying data sets are not standardized. Notably, only few AI applications in orthodontics have reached full clinical maturity and regulatory approval, and researchers in the field are tasked with tackling real-world evaluation and implementation of AI into the orthodontic workflow.

TI  - AI and Face-Driven Orthodontics: A Scoping Review of Digital Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment Planning
T2  - AI
AB  - In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), technological progress is changing established workflows and enabling some basic routines to be updated. In dentistry, the patient's face is a crucial part of treatment planning, although it has always been difficult to grasp in an analytical way. This review highlights the current digital advances that, thanks to AI tools, allow us to implement facial features beyond symmetry and proportionality and incorporate facial analysis into diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics. A Scopus literature search was conducted to identify the topics with the greatest research potential within digital orthodontics over the last five years. The most researched and cited topic was artificial intelligence and its applications in orthodontics. Apart from automated 2D or 3D cephalometric analysis, AI finds its application in facial analysis, decision-making algorithms as well as in the evaluation of treatment progress and retention. Together with AI, other digital advances are shaping the face of today's orthodontics. Without any doubts, the era of "old" orthodontics is at its end, and modern, face-driven orthodontics is on the way to becoming a reality in modern orthodontic practices.

T2  - DENTAL MATERIALS
AB  - Objectives. This paper provides an overview of existing applications and concepts of robotic systems and artificial intelligence in dentistry. This review aims to provide the community with novel inputs and argues for an increased utilization of these recent technological developments, referred to as Dentronics, in order to advance dentistry.
   Methods. First, background on developments in robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reviewed that may enable novel assistive applications in dentistry (Sec A). Second, a systematic technology review that evaluates existing state-of-the-art applications in AI, ML and robotics in the context of dentistry is presented (Sec B).
   Results. A systematic literature research in pubmed yielded in a total of 558 results. 41 studies related to ML, 53 studies related to AI and 49 original research papers on robotics application in dentistry were included. ML and AI have been applied in dental research to analyze large amounts of data to eventually support dental decision making, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning with the help of data-driven analysis algorithms based on machine learning. So far, only few robotic applications have made it to reality, mostly restricted to pilot use cases.
   Significance. The authors believe that dentistry can greatly benefit from the current rise of digital human-centered automation and be transformed towards a new robotic, ML and AI-enabled era. In the future, Dentronics will enhance reliability, reproducibility, accuracy and efficiency in dentistry through the democratized use of modern dental technologies, such as medical robot systems and specialized artificial intelligence. Dentronics will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis, improve risk-assessment-strategies, diagnosis, disease prediction and finally lead to better treatment outcomes.

TI  - Application of deep learning artificial intelligence technique to the classification of clinical orthodontic photos
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - Background Taking facial and intraoral clinical photos is one of the essential parts of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Among the diagnostic procedures, classification of the shuffled clinical photos with their orientations will be the initial step while it was not easy for a machine to classify photos with a variety of facial and dental situations. This article presents a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) deep learning technique to classify orthodontic clinical photos according to their orientations. Methods To build an automated classification system, CNNs models of facial and intraoral categories were constructed, and the clinical photos that are routinely taken for orthodontic diagnosis were used to train the models with data augmentation. Prediction procedures were evaluated with separate photos whose purpose was only for prediction. Results Overall, a 98.0% valid prediction rate resulted for both facial and intraoral photo classification. The highest prediction rate was 100% for facial lateral profile, intraoral upper, and lower photos. Conclusion An artificial intelligence system that utilizes deep learning with proper training models can successfully classify orthodontic facial and intraoral photos automatically. This technique can be used for the first step of a fully automated orthodontic diagnostic system in the future.

TI  - Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a Cephalometric Analysis: A Narrative Review
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) has become more and more widespread in medicine and dentistry. It may contribute to improved quality of health care as diagnostic methods are getting more accurate and diagnostic errors are rarer in daily medical practice. The aim of this paper was to present data from the literature on the effectiveness of AI in orthodontic diagnostics based on the analysis of lateral cephalometric radiographs. A review of the literature from 2009 to 2023 has been performed using PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source databases. The accuracy of determining cephalometric landmarks using widely available commercial AI-based software and advanced AI algorithms was presented and discussed. Most AI algorithms used for the automated positioning of landmarks on cephalometric radiographs had relatively high accuracy. At the same time, the effectiveness of using AI in cephalometry varies depending on the algorithm or the application type, which has to be accounted for during the interpretation of the results. In conclusion, artificial intelligence is a promising tool that facilitates the identification of cephalometric landmarks in everyday clinical practice, may support orthodontic treatment planning for less experienced clinicians and shorten radiological examination in orthodontics. In the future, AI algorithms used for the automated localisation of cephalometric landmarks may be more accurate than manual analysis.

TI  - Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Orthodontics-An Overview and Perspective Based on the Current State of the Art
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application The aim of this article is to provide the reader with an overview of current applications of AI in orthodontics. Artificial intelligence (AI) has already arrived in many areas of our lives and, because of the increasing availability of computing power, can now be used for complex tasks in medicine and dentistry. This is reflected by an exponential increase in scientific publications aiming to integrate AI into everyday clinical routines. Applications of AI in orthodontics are already manifold and range from the identification of anatomical/pathological structures or reference points in imaging to the support of complex decision-making in orthodontic treatment planning. The aim of this article is to give the reader an overview of the current state of the art regarding applications of AI in orthodontics and to provide a perspective for the use of such AI solutions in clinical routine. For this purpose, we present various use cases for AI in orthodontics, for which research is already available. Considering the current scientific progress, it is not unreasonable to assume that AI will become an integral part of orthodontic diagnostics and treatment planning in the near future. Although AI will equally likely not be able to replace the knowledge and experience of human experts in the not-too-distant future, it probably will be able to support practitioners, thus serving as a quality-assuring component in orthodontic patient care.

TI  - Development of a recommender system for dental care using machine learning
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB  - Resource mismanagement along with the underutilization of dental care has led to serious health and economic consequences. Artificial intelligence was applied to a national health database to develop recommendations for dental care. The data were obtained from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to perform machine learning. Feature selection was done using LASSO in R to determine the best regression model. Prediction models were developed using several supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression tree. Feature selection by LASSO along with the inclusion of additional clinically relevant variables identified 8 top features associated with recommendation for dental care. The top 3 features include gum health, number of prescription medications taken, and race. Gum health shows a significantly higher relative importance compared to other features. Demographics, healthcare access, and general health variables were identified as top features related to receiving additional dental care, consistent with prior research. Practicing dentists and other healthcare professionals can follow this model to enable precision dentistry through the incorporation of our algorithms into computerized screening tool or decision tree diagram to achieve more efficient and personalized preventive strategies and treatment protocols in dental care.

TI  - Teeth infection and fatigue prediction using optimized neural networks and big data analytic tool
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Despite the rapid improvement in dental health over the last few decades, a significant portion of our population continue seek dental care every year. Estimates show that 13% of adults seek dental care for dental infection or fatigue within four years. The Social and individual burden of this disease can be reduced by its early detection. However, the symptoms of teeth infection in the early stages are not clear, hence, it would be relatively difficult to predict teeth infections based solely on human skills and experience. Big Data (BD) technologies have a great potential in transforming dental care, as they have revolutionized other industries. In addition to reducing cost, they could save millions of lives and improve patient outcomes. This paper proposes a novel integrated prediction model that extracts hidden knowledge from radiographic datasets containing a large volume of dental X-ray images and utilizes this knowledge to predict dental infections. Initially, preprocessing techniques using morphological skeleton and mean approach is applied to eliminate noise and enhance the images. Next, Multi Scale Segmented Region (MSR) approach, Watershed Approach (WA), Sobel edge Detection (SD), Histogram based Segmentation (HS), Trainable Segmentation (TS), Dual Clustering (DC), and Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) are examined for image segmentation and feature extraction. Among these methods, MSR was selected for feature extraction since it outperformed other methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, precision, recall and F1-score. Then, a set of neural network classifiers are trained to identify patterns in the extracted optimized features and predict dental infections. For this purpose, we have examined Bacterial Optimized Recurrent Neural Networks (BORNN), Deep Learning Neural Networks (DANN), Genetic Optimized Neural Networks (GONN) and Adaptive Neural Networks Algorithm (ADNN). BORNN have shown maximum accuracy and Roc value (98.1% and 0.92 respectively), and minimum error values (MSE = 0.189, MAE = 0.143). The output of the proposed integrated prediction model is fed into a dental robot who proceeds with the treatment process with high accuracy and minimum delay. The proposed prediction model was implemented using a big data analytics tool called Apache SAMOA and experimental results showed its correctness and effectiveness.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Chances and Challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The term "artificial intelligence" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which "learns" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute ("explainable AI"). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.

TI  - Diagnostic charting of panoramic radiography using deep-learning artificial intelligence system
T2  - ORAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of a new deep-learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for diagnostic charting in panoramic radiography. Methods One thousand eighty-four anonymous dental panoramic radiographs were labeled by two dento-maxillofacial radiologists for ten different dental situations: crown, pontic, root-canal treated tooth, implant, implant-supported crown, impacted tooth, residual root, filling, caries, and dental calculus. AI Model CranioCatch, developed in Eskisehir, Turkey and based on a deep CNN method, was proposed to be evaluated. A Faster R-CNN Inception v2 (COCO) model implemented with the TensorFlow library was used for model development. The assessment of AI model performance was evaluated with sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. Results When the performance of the proposed AI model for detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs was evaluated, the best sensitivity values were obtained from the crown, implant, and impacted tooth as 0.9674, 0.9615, and 0.9658, respectively. The worst sensitivity values were obtained from the pontic, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.7738, 0.3026, and 0.0934, respectively. The best precision values were obtained from pontic, implant, implant-supported crown as 0.8783, 0.9259, and 0.8947, respectively. The worst precision values were obtained from residual root, caries, and dental calculus, as 0.6764, 0.5096, and 0.1923, respectively. The most successful F1 Scores were obtained from the implant, crown, and implant-supported crown, as 0.9433, 0.9122, and 0.8947, respectively. Conclusion The proposed AI model has promising results at detecting dental conditions in panoramic radiographs, except for caries and dental calculus. Thanks to the improvement of AI models in all areas of dental radiology, we predict that they will help physicians in panoramic diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as digital-based student education, especially during the pandemic period.

TI  - The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Accurate Diagnosis and Treatment Planning of Non-Syndromic Supernumerary Teeth: A Case Report in a Six-Year-Old Boy
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
AB  - Hyperdontia can cause numerous aesthetic and functional problems. The diagnosis is made radiologically, and the most commonly used radiological method is orthopantomography, while CBCT is also used. CBCT has the advantage of being three-dimensional. Artificial Intelligence is widely used in medicine and dentistry, and it can create a specific algorithm to aid in diagnosis and suggest therapeutic procedures. In a case report, a 6-year-old boy was diagnosed with a supernumerary tooth between the upper central incisors. Orthopantomography revealed another impacted supernumerary tooth, and the patient was referred for CBCT. A platform for analyzing dental images, based on artificial intelligence, Diagnocat (Diagnocat Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA), was used for analysis and the AI system identified the supernumerary teeth and provided a complete plan for treatment. The use of AI in dentistry allows for faster and more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

TI  - A Novel Machine Learning Model for Predicting Orthodontic Treatment Duration
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - In the field of orthodontics, providing patients with accurate treatment time estimates is of utmost importance. As orthodontic practices continue to evolve and embrace new advancements, incorporating machine learning (ML) methods becomes increasingly valuable in improving orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. This study aimed to develop a novel ML model capable of predicting the orthodontic treatment duration based on essential pre-treatment variables. Patients who completed comprehensive orthodontic treatment at the Indiana University School of Dentistry were included in this retrospective study. Fifty-seven pre-treatment variables were collected and used to train and test nine different ML models. The performance of each model was assessed using descriptive statistics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and one-way analysis of variance tests. Random Forest, Lasso, and Elastic Net were found to be the most accurate, with a mean absolute error of 7.27 months in predicting treatment duration. Extraction decision, COVID, intermaxillary relationship, lower incisor position, and additional appliances were identified as important predictors of treatment duration. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of ML in predicting orthodontic treatment duration using pre-treatment variables.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for treatment planning and soft tissue outcome prediction of orthognathic treatment: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Background: The accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) in treatment planning and outcome prediction in orthognathic treatment (OGT) has not been systematically reviewed.
   Objectives: To determine the accuracy of AI in treatment planning and soft tissue outcome prediction in OGT.
   Design: Systematic review.
   Data sources: Unrestricted search of indexed databases and reference lists of included studies.
   Data selection: Clinical studies that addressed the focused question 'Is AI useful for treatment planning and soft tissue outcome prediction in OGT?' were included.
   Data extraction: Study screening, selection and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RoB and ROBINS-I tools for randomised and nonrandomised clinical studies, respectively.
   Data synthesis: Eight clinical studies (seven retrospective cohort studies and one randomised controlled study) were included. Four studies assessed the role of AI for treatment decision making; and four studies assessed the accuracy of AI in soft tissue outcome prediction after OGT. In four studies, the level of agreement between AI and non-AI decision making was found to be clinically acceptable (at least 90%). In four studies, it was shown that AI can be used for soft tissue outcome prediction after OGT; however, predictions were not clinically acceptable for the lip and chin areas. All studies had a low to moderate RoB.
   Limitations: Due to high methodological inconsistencies among the included studies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis and reporting biases assessment.
   Conclusion: AI can be a useful aid to traditional treatment planning by facilitating clinical treatment decision making and providing a visualisation tool for soft tissue outcome prediction in OGT.

TI  - Machine Learning Predictive Model as Clinical Decision Support System in Orthodontic Treatment Planning
T2  - DENTISTRY JOURNAL
AB  - Diagnosis and treatment planning forms the crux of orthodontics, which orthodontists gain with years of expertise. Machine Learning (ML), having the ability to learn by pattern recognition, can gain this expertise in a very short duration, ensuring reduced error, inter-intra clinician variability and good accuracy. Thus, the aim of this study was to construct an ML predictive model to predict a broader outline of the orthodontic diagnosis and treatment plan. The sample consisted of 700 case records of orthodontically treated patients in the past ten years. The data were split into a training and a test set. There were 33 input variables and 11 output variables. Four ML predictive model layers with seven algorithms were created. The test set was used to check the efficacy of the ML-predicted treatment plan and compared with that of the decision made by the expert orthodontists. The model showed an overall average accuracy of 84%, with the Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGB classifier algorithms showing the highest accuracy ranging from 87-93%. Yet in their infancy stages, Machine Learning models could become a valuable Clinical Decision Support System in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning in the future.

TI  - Assessing the Efficacy of AI Segmentation in Diagnostics of Nine Supernumerary Teeth in a Pediatric Patient
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - We present a very rare case of a child with nine supernumerary teeth to analyze the potential, benefits, and limitations of artificial intelligence, as well as two commercial tools for tooth segmentation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly finding applications in dentistry today, particularly in radiography. Special attention is given to models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and their application in automatic segmentation of the oral cavity and tooth structures. The integration of AI is gaining increasing attention, and the automation of the detection and localization of supernumerary teeth can accelerate the treatment planning process. Despite advancements in 3D segmentation techniques, relying on trained professionals remains crucial. Therefore, human expertise should remain key, and AI should be seen as a support rather than a replacement. Generally, a comprehensive tool that can satisfy all clinical needs in terms of supernumerary teeth and their segmentation is not yet available, so it is necessary to incorporate multiple tools into practice.

TI  - Current Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Pediatric Dentistry: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY
AB  - Purpose: To systematically evaluate artificial intelligence applications for diagnostic and treatment planning possibilities in pediatric queries. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) checklist was used to assess the risk of bias assessment of the included studies. Results: Based on the initial screening, 33 eligible studies were included (among 3,542). Eleven studies appeared to have low bias risk across all QUADAS-2 domains. Most applications focused on early childhood caries diagnosis and prediction, tooth identification, oral health evaluation, and supernumerary tooth identification. Six studies evaluated AI tools for mesiodens or supernumerary tooth identification on radigraphs, four for primary tooth identification and/or numbering, seven studies to detect caries on radiographs, and 12 to predict early childhood caries. For these four tasks, the reported accuracy of AI varied from 60 percent to 99 percent, sensitivity was from 20 percent to 100 percent, specificity was from 49 percent to 100 percent, F1-score was from 60 percent to 97 percent, and the area-under-the-curve varied from 87 percent to 100 percent. Conclusions: The overall body of evidence regarding artificial intelligence applications in pediatric dentistry does not allow for firm conclusions. For a wide range of applications, AI shows promising accuracy. Future studies should focus on a comparison of AI against the standard of care and employ a set of standardized outcomes and metrics to allow comparison across studies.

TI  - The role of neural artificial intelligence for diagnosis and treatment planning in endodontics: A qualitative review
T2  - SAUDI DENTAL JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction: The role of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently increasing in terms of diagnosing diseases and planning treatment in endodontics. However, findings from individual research studies are not systematically reviewed and compiled together. Hence, this study aimed to systematically review, appraise, and evaluate neural AI algorithms employed and their comparative efficacy to conventional methods in endodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.Methods: The present research question focused on the literature search about different AI algorithms and models of AI assisted endodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. The search engine included databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct with search criteria of primary research paper, published in English, and analyzed data on AI and its role in the field of endodontics.Results: The initial search resulted in 785 articles, exclusion based on abstract relevance, animal studies, grey literature and letter to editors narrowed down the scope of selected articles to 11 accepted for review. The review data supported the findings that AI can play a crucial role in the area of endodontics, such as identification of apical lesions, classifying and numbering teeth, detecting dental caries, periodontitis and periapical disease, diagnosing different dental problems, helping dentists make referrals, and also helping them make plans for treatment of dental disorders in a timely and effective manner with greater accuracy.Conclusion: AI with different models or frameworks and algorithms can help dentists to diagnose and manage endodontic problems with greater accuracy. However, endodontic fraternity needs to provide more emphasis on the utilization of AI, provision of evidence based guidelines and implementation of the AI models.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Possibilities of artificial intelligence use in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning: Image recognition and three-dimensional VTO
T2  - SEMINARS IN ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Orthodontic diagnosis is a comprehensive procedure that integrates various information obtained from the facial and occlusal structure as well as patient's individual needs. Hence it is not easy to imagine if the artificial intelligence(AI) would eventually replace the conventional diagnostic process. Nonetheless, recent advances in the machine learning and artificial intelligence have been applied to the cephalometric tracing and model analysis via automated image recognition, exhibiting relatively high reliability. Based on the cumulated experiences and research outcomes, orthodontic diagnostics have taken a small step towards an automated process. Considering that the orthodontic diagnosis starts from the recognition of the space discrepancy between the initial status and idealized occlusion, semi-automated three-dimensional visualized treatment objectives (VTO) may be established. This article covers the brief overview of the current status in machine learning especially focusing on the image recognition. Recent advances in the fabrication of three-dimensional VTO using surface landmarks and automated setup process is demonstrated. In the near future, a more clinically relevant VTO can be utilized using the imaginary center of resistance, to provide useful clues to the orthodontists in many of the borderline cases between extraction and non-extraction, and between surgery and non-surgery.

TI  - Call for algorithmic fairness to mitigate amplification of racial biases in artificial intelligence models used in orthodontics and craniofacial health
T2  - ORTHODONTICS & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH
AB  - Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is being increasingly used in Orthodontics and craniofacial health for predicting clinical outcomes. Current ML/AI models are prone to accentuate racial disparities. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of how AI/ML models perpetuate racial biases and how we can mitigate this situation. A narrative review of articles published in the medical literature on racial biases and the use of AI/ML models was undertaken. Current AI/ML models are built on homogenous clinical datasets that have a gross underrepresentation of historically disadvantages demographic groups, especially the ethno-racial minorities. The consequence of such AI/ML models is that they perform poorly when deployed on ethno-racial minorities thus further amplifying racial biases. Healthcare providers, policymakers, AI developers and all stakeholders should pay close attention to various steps in the pipeline of building AI/ML models and every effort must be made to establish algorithmic fairness to redress inequities.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery: a bibliometric analysis of the 100 most-cited articles
T2  - HEAD & FACE MEDICINE
AB  - Background The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery has gained significant attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of bibliometric reports that analyze the academic literature in this field to identify publishing and citation trends. By conducting an analysis of the top 100 most-cited articles on AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery, we aim to unveil popular research topics, key authors, institutions, countries, and journals in this area.Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) electronic database to identify the top 100 most-cited articles on AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Publication and citation data were obtained and further analyzed and visualized using R Biblioshiny. The key domains of the 100 articles were also identified.Results The top 100 most-cited articles were published between 2005 and 2022, contributed by 458 authors, with an average citation count of 22.09. South Korea emerged as the leading contributor with the highest number of publications (28) and citations (595), followed by China (16, 373), and the United States (7, 248). Notably, six South Korean authors ranked among the top 10 contributors, and three South Korean institutions were listed as the most productive. International collaborations were predominantly observed between the United States, China, and South Korea. The main domains of the articles focused on automated imaging assessment (42%), aiding diagnosis and treatment planning (34%), and the assessment of growth and development (10%). Besides, a positive correlation was observed between the testing sample size and citation counts (P = 0.010), as well as between the time of publication and citation counts (P < 0.001).Conclusions The utilization of AI in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery has shown remarkable progress, particularly in the domains of imaging analysis, diagnosis and treatment planning, and growth and development assessment. This bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the top-cited articles and the trends of AI research in this field.

TI  - Classification of Maxillofacial Morphology by Artificial Intelligence Using Cephalometric Analysis Measurements
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - The characteristics of maxillofacial morphology play a major role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. While Sassouni's classification scheme outlines different categories of maxillofacial morphology, there is no standardized approach to assigning these classifications to patients. This study aimed to create an artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses cephalometric analysis measurements to accurately classify maxillofacial morphology, allowing for the standardization of maxillofacial morphology classification. This study used the initial cephalograms of 220 patients aged 18 years or older. Three orthodontists classified the maxillofacial morphologies of 220 patients using eight measurements as the accurate classification. Using these eight cephalometric measurement points and the subject's gender as input features, a random forest classifier from the Python sci-kit learning package was trained and tested with a k-fold split of five to determine orthodontic classification; distinct models were created for horizontal-only, vertical-only, and combined maxillofacial morphology classification. The accuracy of the combined facial classification was 0.823 & PLUSMN; 0.060; for anteroposterior-only classification, the accuracy was 0.986 & PLUSMN; 0.011; and for the vertical-only classification, the accuracy was 0.850 & PLUSMN; 0.037. ANB angle had the greatest feature importance at 0.3519. The AI model created in this study accurately classified maxillofacial morphology, but it can be further improved with more learning data input.

TI  - Application of artificial intelligence in the dental field: A literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to comprehensively review the literature regarding the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the dental field, focusing on the evaluation criteria and architecture types. Study selection: Electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus) were searched. Full-text articles describing the clinical application of AI for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of lesions and the AI method/architecture were included. Results: The primary search presented 422 studies from 1996 to 2019, and 58 studies were finally selected. Regarding the year of publication, the oldest study, which was reported in 1996, focused on "oral and maxillofacial surgery." Machine-learning architectures were employed in the selected studies, while approximately half of them (29/58) employed neural networks. Regarding the evaluation criteria, eight studies compared the results obtained by AI with the diagnoses for-mulated by dentists, while several studies compared two or more architectures in terms of performance. The following parameters were employed for evaluating the AI performance: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusion: Application of AI in the dental field has progressed; however, the criteria for evaluating the efficacy of AI have not been clarified. It is necessary to obtain better quality data for machine learning to achieve the effective diagnosis of lesions and suitable treatment planning.

TI  - An artificial intelligence model for instance segmentation and tooth numbering on orthopantomograms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERIZED DENTISTRY
AB  - Aim: To develop a deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) model for instance segmentation and tooth numbering on orthopantomograms (OPGs). Materials and methods: Forty OPGs were manually annotated to lay down the ground truth for training two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): U-net and Faster RCNN. These algorithms were concurrently trained and validated on a dataset of 1280 teeth (40 OPGs) each. The U-net algorithm was trained on OPGs specifically annotated with polygons to label all 32 teeth via instance segmentation, allowing each tooth to be denoted as a separate entity from the surrounding structures. Simultaneously, teeth were also numbered according to the Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI) numbering system, using bounding boxes to train Faster RCNN. Consequently, both trained CNNs were combined to develop an AI model capable of segmenting and numbering all teeth on an OPG. Results: The performance of the U-net algorithm was determined using various performance metrics including precision = 88.8%, accuracy = 88.2%, recall = 87.3%, F-1 score = 88%, dice index = 92.3%, and Intersection over Union (IoU) = 86.3%. The performance metrics of the Faster RCNN algorithm were determined using overlap accuracy = 30.2 bounding boxes (out of a possible of 32 boxes) and classifier accuracy of labels = 93.8%. Conclusions: The instance segmentation and tooth numbering results of our trained AI model were close to the ground truth, indicating a promising future for their incorporation into clinical dental practice. The ability of an AI model to automatically identify teeth on OPGs will aid dentists with diagnosis and treatment planning, thus increasing efficiency.

TI  - Deep Learning Models for Classification of Deciduous and Permanent Teeth From Digital Panoramic Images
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Dental radiographs are essential in the diagnostic process in dentistry. They serve various purposes, including determining age, analyzing patterns of tooth eruption/shedding, and treatment planning and prognosis. The emergence of digital radiography technology has piqued interest in using artificial intelligence systems to assist and guide dental professionals. These cutting-edge technologies assist in streamlining decision-making processes by enabling entity classification and localization tasks. With the integration of artificial Intelligence algorithms tailored for pediatric dentistry applications and utilizing automated tools, there is an optimistic outlook on improving diagnostic capabilities while reducing stress and fatigue among clinicians. Methodology: The dataset comprised 620 images (mixed dentition: 314, permanent dentition: 306). Panoramic radiographs taken were within the age range of 4-16 years. The classification of deciduous and permanent teeth involved training CNN-based models using different architectures such as Resnet, AlexNet, and EfficientNet, among others. A ratio of 70:15:15 was utilized for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Result and conclusion: The findings indicated that among the models proposed, EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 exhibited superior performance. Both EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB3 achieved an accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 98% in classifying teeth as either deciduous or permanent. This implies that these models were highly accurate in identifying patterns/features within the dataset used for evaluation.

Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve automated landmark localization has proved feasible and convenient. However, current systems remain insufficient for clinical application, as patients exhibit various maloc-clusions in cephalograms produced by different manufacturers while limited cephalograms were applied to train AI in these systems.Methods: A robust and clinically applicable AI system was proposed for automatic ceph-alometric analysis. First, 9870 cephalograms taken by different radiography machines with various malocclusions of patients were collected from 20 medical institutions. Then 30 land-marks of all these cephalogram samples were manually annotated to train an AI system, composed of a two -stage convolutional neural network and a software -as - a-service system. Further, more than 100 orthodontists participated to refine the AI-output landmark localiza-tions and retrain this system.Results: The average landmark prediction error of this system was as low as 0.94 +/- 0.74 mm and the system achieved an average classification accuracy of 89.33%.Conclusions: An automatic cephalometric analysis system based on convolutional neural network was proposed, which can realize automatic landmark location and cephalometric measurements classification. This system showed promise in improving diagnostic efficiency in clinical circumstances.

TI  - Diagnosis of Tooth Prognosis Using Artificial Intelligence
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - The accurate diagnosis of individual tooth prognosis has to be determined comprehensively in consideration of the broader treatment plan. The objective of this study was to establish an effective artificial intelligence (AI)-based module for an accurate tooth prognosis decision based on the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) comprehensive treatment planning curriculum (CTPC). The tooth prognosis of 2359 teeth from 94 cases was evaluated with 1 to 5 levels (1-Hopeless, 5-Good condition for long term) by two groups (Model-A with 16, and Model-B with 13 examiners) based on 17 clinical determining factors selected from the HSDM-CTPC. Three AI machine-learning methods including gradient boosting classifier, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier were used to create an algorithm. These three methods were evaluated against the gold standard data determined by consensus of three experienced prosthodontists, and their accuracy was analyzed. The decision tree classifier indicated the highest accuracy at 0.8413 (Model-A) and 0.7523 (Model-B). Accuracy with the gradient boosting classifier and the random forest classifier was 0.6896, 0.6687, and 0.8413, 0.7523, respectively. Overall, the decision tree classifier had the best accuracy among the three methods. The study contributes to the implementation of AI in the decision-making process of tooth prognosis in consideration of the treatment plan.

TI  - Automated detection and labelling of teeth and small edentulous regions on cone-beam computed tomography using convolutional neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objective: To assess the accuracy of a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven tool for automated detection of teeth and small edentulous regions on Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images.Materials and Methods: After AI training and testing with 175 CBCT scans (130 for training and 40 for testing), validation was performed on a total of 46 CBCT scans selected for this purpose. Scans were split into fully dentate and partially dentate patients (small edentulous regions). The AI Driven tool (Virtual Patient Creator, Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium) automatically detected, segmented and labelled teeth and edentulous regions. Human performance served as clinical reference. Accuracy and speed of the AI-driven tool to detect and label teeth and edentulous regions in partially edentulous jaws were assessed. Automatic tooth segmentation was compared to manually refined segmentation and accuracy by means of Intersetion over Union (IoU) and 95% Hausdorff Distance served as a secondary outcome.Results: The AI-driven tool achieved a general accuracy of 99.7% and 99% for detection and labelling of teeth and missing teeth for both fully dentate and partially dentate patients, respectively. Automated detections took a median time of 1.5s, while the human operator median time was 98s (P<0.0001). Segmentation accuracy measured by Intersection over Union was 0.96 and 0.97 for fully dentate and partially edentulous jaws respectively.Conclusions: The AI-driven tool was accurate and fast for CBCT-based detection, segmentation and labelling of teeth and missing teeth in partial edentulism. ClinicalSignificance: The use of AI may represent a promising time-saving tool serving radiological reporting, with a major step forward towards automated dental charting, as well as surgical and treatment planning.

TI  - Personalized dental medicine, artificial intelligence, and their relevance for dentomaxillofacial imaging
T2  - DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Personalized medicine refers to the tailoring of diagnostics and therapeutics to individuals based on one's biological, social, and behavioral characteristics. While personalized dental medicine is still far from being a reality, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with improved data analytic approaches are expected to integrate diverse data from the individual, setting, and system levels, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the interaction of these multilevel data and therefore bring us closer to more personalized, predictive, preven-tive, and participatory dentistry, also known as P4 dentistry. In the field of dentomaxillofacial imaging, a wide range of AI applications, including several commercially available software options, have been proposed to assist dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of various dentomaxillofacial diseases, with performance similar or even superior to that of specialists. Notably, the impact of these dental AI applications on treatment decision, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness has so far been assessed sparsely. Such information should be further investigated in future studies to provide patients, providers, and healthcare organizers a clearer picture of the true usefulness of AI in daily dental practice.

TI  - The Impetus of Artificial Intelligence on Periodontal Diagnosis: A Brief Synopsis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - The current advances in digitized data additions, machine learning and computing framework, lead to the swiftly emerging concept of "Artificial Intelligence" (AI), that are developing into areas that were formerly contemplated for human expertise. AI is a relatively rapid paced mechanics wherein the computer technology is tuned to perform human tasks. An auxiliary domain of AI is machine learning (ML), and Deep learning, a subclass of ML technique comprehends multi-layer mathematical operations. AI-based applications have tremendous potential to improve and systematize patient care thereby alleviating dentists from laborious regular tasks, and facilitate personalized, predictive and preventive dentistry. In the dental clinic, AI can execute a variety of easy tasks with greater accuracy, minimal manpower, and with fewer mistakes over human equivalents. These tasks range from appointment scheduling and coordination to helping with clinical evaluation and therapy. Besides, this could assist in the early diagnosis of dental and maxillofacial abnormalities like periodontal ailments, root caries, bony lesions, and facial malformations in addition to automatically identifying and classifying dental restorations on digital radiographs. This brusque narrative review describes the AI-based systems, their respective applications in periodontal diagnosis, the multifarious studies, possible limitations and the predictable future of AI-based dental diagnostics and treatment planning.

TI  - Machine learning and orthodontics, current trends and the future opportunities: A scoping review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
AB  - Introduction: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various ways in medicine and dentistry. Advancements in AI technology show promising results in the practice of orthodontics. This scoping review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of AI-based models employed in orthodontic landmark detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. Methods: A precise search of electronic databases was conducted, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase (English publications from January 2010 to July 2020). Quality Assessment and Diagnostic Accuracy Tool 2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the quality of the articles included in this review. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 49 articles were included in the final review. AI technology has achieved state-of-the-art results in various orthodontic applications, including automated landmark detection on lateral cephalograms and photography images, cervical vertebra maturation degree determination, skeletal classification, orthodontic tooth extraction decisions, predicting the need for orthodontic treatment or orthognathic surgery, and facial attractiveness. Most of the AI models used in these applications are based on artificial neural networks. Conclusions: AI can help orthodontists save time and provide accuracy comparable to the trained dentists in diagnostic assessments and prognostic predictions. These systems aim to boost performance and enhance the quality of care in orthodontics. However, based on current studies, the most promising application was cephalometry landmark detection, skeletal classification, and decision making on tooth extractions.

TI  - Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Dental Education: A Review and Guide for Curriculum Update
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - In this intellectual work, the clinical and educational aspects of dentistry were confronted with practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.'s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt. However, there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal implications, and further consensus is needed for the safe and responsible implementation of AI in dental education.

TI  - Exploring the Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Clinical Healthcare: A Multidisciplinary Review
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a more and more important role in our everyday life due to the advantages that it brings when used, such as 24/7 availability, a very low percentage of errors, ability to provide real time insights, or performing a fast analysis. AI is increasingly being used in clinical medical and dental healthcare analyses, with valuable applications, which include disease diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment planning, and drug discovery. This paper presents a narrative literature review of AI use in healthcare from a multi-disciplinary perspective, specifically in the cardiology, allergology, endocrinology, and dental fields. The paper highlights data from recent research and development efforts in AI for healthcare, as well as challenges and limitations associated with AI implementation, such as data privacy and security considerations, along with ethical and legal concerns. The regulation of responsible design, development, and use of AI in healthcare is still in early stages due to the rapid evolution of the field. However, it is our duty to carefully consider the ethical implications of implementing AI and to respond appropriately. With the potential to reshape healthcare delivery and enhance patient outcomes, AI systems continue to reveal their capabilities.

TI  - Intra-oral scan segmentation using deep learning
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveIntra-oral scans and gypsum cast scans (OS) are widely used in orthodontics, prosthetics, implantology, and orthognathic surgery to plan patient-specific treatments, which require teeth segmentations with high accuracy and resolution. Manual teeth segmentation, the gold standard up until now, is time-consuming, tedious, and observer-dependent. This study aims to develop an automated teeth segmentation and labeling system using deep learning.Material and methodsAs a reference, 1750 OS were manually segmented and labeled. A deep-learning approach based on PointCNN and 3D U-net in combination with a rule-based heuristic algorithm and a combinatorial search algorithm was trained and validated on 1400 OS. Subsequently, the trained algorithm was applied to a test set consisting of 350 OS. The intersection over union (IoU), as a measure of accuracy, was calculated to quantify the degree of similarity between the annotated ground truth and the model predictions.ResultsThe model achieved accurate teeth segmentations with a mean IoU score of 0.915. The FDI labels of the teeth were predicted with a mean accuracy of 0.894. The optical inspection showed excellent position agreements between the automatically and manually segmented teeth components. Minor flaws were mostly seen at the edges.ConclusionThe proposed method forms a promising foundation for time-effective and observer-independent teeth segmentation and labeling on intra-oral scans.Clinical significanceDeep learning may assist clinicians in virtual treatment planning in orthodontics, prosthetics, implantology, and orthognathic surgery. The impact of using such models in clinical practice should be explored.

TI  - The Learning Curve of Artificial Intelligence for Dental Implant Treatment Planning: A Descriptive Study
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application:& nbsp;Authors are encouraged to provide a concise description of the specific application or a potential application of the work. This section is not mandatory.& nbsp;Introduction: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been applied to implant dentistry. The increasing use of this technology produces a critical number of images that can be used for training artificial intelligence (AI). Objectives: To investigate the learning curve of the developed AI for dental implant planning in the posterior maxillary region. Methods: A total of 184 CBCT image sets of patients receiving posterior maxillary implants were processed with software (DentiPlan Pro version 3.7; NECTEC, NSTDA, Thailand) to acquire 316 implant position images. The planning software image interfaces were anonymously captured with full-screen resolution. Three hundred images were randomly sorted to create six data sets, including 1-50, 1-100, 1-150, 1-200, 1-250, and 1-300. The data sets were used to develop AI for dental implant planning through the IBM PowerAI Vision platform (IBM Thailand Co., Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) by using a faster R-CNN algorithm. Four data augmentation algorithms, including blur, sharpen, color, and noise, were also integrated to observe the improvement of the model. After the testing process with 16 images that were not included in the training set, the recorded data were analyzed for detection and accuracy to generate the learning curve of the model. Results: The learning curve revealed some similar patterns. The curve trend of the original and blurred augmented models was in a similar pattern in the panoramic image. In the last training set, the blurred augmented model improved the detection by 12.50%, but showed less accuracy than the original model by 18.34%, whereas the other three augmented models had different patterns. They were continuously increasing in both detection and accuracy. However, their detection dropped in the last training set. The colored augmented model demonstrated the best improvement with 40% for the panoramic image and 18.59% for the cross-sectional image. Conclusions: Within the limitation of the study, it may be concluded that the number of images used in AI development is positively related to the AI interpretation. The data augmentation techniques to improve the ability of AI are still questionable.

TI  - Multiclass CBCT Image Segmentation for Orthodontics with Deep Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Accurate segmentation of the jaw (i.e., mandible and maxilla) and the teeth in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is essential for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Although various (semi)automated methods have been proposed to segment the jaw or the teeth, there is still a lack of fully automated segmentation methods that can simultaneously segment both anatomic structures in CBCT scans (i.e., multiclass segmentation). In this study, we aimed to train and validate a mixed-scale dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network for multiclass segmentation of the jaw, the teeth, and the background in CBCT scans. Thirty CBCT scans were obtained from patients who had undergone orthodontic treatment. Gold standard segmentation labels were manually created by 4 dentists. As a benchmark, we also evaluated MS-D networks that segmented the jaw or the teeth (i.e., binary segmentation). All segmented CBCT scans were converted to virtual 3-dimensional (3D) models. The segmentation performance of all trained MS-D networks was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient and surface deviation. The CBCT scans segmented by the MS-D network demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentations (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.934 +/- 0.019, jaw; 0.945 +/- 0.021, teeth). The MS-D network-based 3D models of the jaw and the teeth showed minor surface deviations when compared with the corresponding gold standard 3D models (0.390 +/- 0.093 mm, jaw; 0.204 +/- 0.061 mm, teeth). The MS-D network took approximately 25 s to segment 1 CBCT scan, whereas manual segmentation took about 5 h. This study showed that multiclass segmentation of jaw and teeth was accurate and its performance was comparable to binary segmentation. The MS-D network trained for multiclass segmentation would therefore make patient-specific orthodontic treatment more feasible by strongly reducing the time required to segment multiple anatomic structures in CBCT scans.

T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - The first stage of digestion starts from the mouth. If the teeth are not in good health, they may affect the person's eating and cause a disturbance in the digestive system. In addition, damaged teeth cause a person's self-confidence to decline while laughing and talking. Therefore, diagnosing and treating damaged teeth is of great importance in dentistry. Deep learning has been able to speed up and improve human performance in identifying many dental diseases, diagnosing oral cancer, and diagnosing the treatment stage. In medicine, deep learning applications face challenges due to the need for labeled datasets, and the field of dentistry is no exception. This pilot study used 1025 dental x-ray panoramic images of patients over 14 for dental treatment planning. A dentist with more than 25 years of experience assisted us in conducting this research. The dentist consulted with other dentists in his team to increase the reliability of the treatment plans presented for each panoramic image and then labeled the images. After labeling these images, YOLOv7, which belongs to the family of the You Only Look Once (YOLO), a convolutional neural network model, is used to process the images due to its advantages, especially performing quickly with high accuracy on small datasets. The proposed model identifies damaged teeth by drawing bounding boxes around them, then indicates the proper treatment plan for each damaged tooth state. The released treatment plan concludes an overall of 8 distinct treatments which can be applied in multiple stages to cure the teeth. After training the model, it was tested on the test set, a portion of the dataset that was not used to train the model, to evaluate its performance. The model achieves a precision of 100%, F1 score of 76%, Recall of 96%, and mAP of 81.9%, indicating that this model has excellent potential for clinical use by dentists.

T2  - CLINICAL ORAL INVESTIGATIONS
AB  - Objectives This review aims to share the current developments of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the field of medico-dental diagnostics of the face. The primary focus of this review is to present the applicability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to interpret medical images, together with the associated opportunities, obstacles, and ethico-legal concerns. Material and methods Narrative literature review. Results Narrative literature review. Conclusion Curated facial images are widely available and easily accessible and are as such particularly suitable big data for ANN training. New AI solutions have the potential to change contemporary dentistry by optimizing existing processes and enriching dental care with the introduction of new tools for assessment or treatment planning. The analyses of health-related big data may also contribute to revolutionize personalized medicine through the detection of previously unknown associations. In regard to facial images, advances in medico-dental AI-based diagnostics include software solutions for the detection and classification of pathologies, for rating attractiveness and for the prediction of age or gender. In order for an ANN to be suitable for medical diagnostics of the face, the arising challenges regarding computation and management of the software are discussed, with special emphasis on the use of non-medical big data for ANN training. The legal and ethical ramifications of feeding patients' facial images to a neural network for diagnostic purposes are related to patient consent, data privacy, data security, liability, and intellectual property. Current ethico-legal regulation practices seem incapable of addressing all concerns and ensuring accountability. Clinical significance While this review confirms the many benefits derived from AI solutions used for the diagnosis of medical images, it highlights the evident lack of regulatory oversight, the urgent need to establish licensing protocols, and the imperative to investigate the moral quality of new norms set with the implementation of AI applications in medico-dental diagnostics.

TI  - Extended Arm of Precision in Prosthodontics: Artificial Intelligence
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Dentistry based on artificial intelligence (AI) is not a myth but turning into a reality. AI has revolutionized medicine and dentistry in various ways. AI is a technology that uses machines to imitate intelligent human behavior. AI is gaining popularity worldwide because of its significant impact and breakthrough in the field of intelligence innovation. It is a lifesaver in dentistry, particularly in the field of prosthodontics, because it aids in the design of prostheses and the fabrication of functional maxillofacial appliances. It also helps in the processes of patient documentation, diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management, allowing oral healthcare professionals to work smarter rather than harder. While it cannot replace the work of a dentist because dentistry is not about disease diagnosis, it does involve correlation with other clinical findings and provides treatment to the patient. The integration of AI and digitization has brought a new paradigm in dentistry, with extremely promising prospects. The availability of insufficient and inaccurate data is now the only barrier to the deployment of AI. Therefore, dentists and clinicians must focus on collecting and entering authentic data into their database, which will be completely utilized for AI in dentistry shortly. This study focuses on various applications of AI in prosthodontics along with its limitations and future scope.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in dentistry: Harnessing big data to predict oral cancer survival
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Oral cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide. Public knowledge in oral cancer risk factors and survival is limited.
   AIM
   To come up with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the length of survival for individuals diagnosed with oral cancer, and to explore the most important factors that were responsible for shortening or lengthening oral cancer survival.
   METHODS
   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from the years 1975 to 2016 that consisted of a total of 257880 cases and 94 variables. Four ML techniques in the area of artificial intelligence were applied for model training and validation. Model accuracy was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-2 and adjusted R-2.
   RESULTS
   The most important factors predictive of oral cancer survival time were age at diagnosis, primary cancer site, tumor size and year of diagnosis. Year of diagnosis referred to the year when the tumor was first diagnosed, implying that individuals with tumors that were diagnosed in the modern era tend to have longer survival than those diagnosed in the past. The extreme gradient boosting ML algorithms showed the best performance, with the MAE equaled to 13.55, MSE 486.55 and RMSE 22.06.
   CONCLUSION
   Using artificial intelligence, we developed a tool that can be used for oral cancer survival prediction and for medical-decision making. The finding relating to the year of diagnosis represented an important new discovery in the literature. The results of this study have implications for cancer prevention and education for the public.

TI  - Current Applications, Opportunities, and Limitations of AI for 3D Imaging in Dental Research and Practice
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The increasing use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques in dental medicine has boosted the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for various clinical problems. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and intraoral/facial scans are potential sources of image data to develop 3D image-based AI systems for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and prediction of treatment outcome. This review focuses on current developments and performance of AI for 3D imaging in dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR) as well as intraoral and facial scanning. In DMFR, machine learning-based algorithms proposed in the literature focus on three main applications, including automated diagnosis of dental and maxillofacial diseases, localization of anatomical landmarks for orthodontic and orthognathic treatment planning, and general improvement of image quality. Automatic recognition of teeth and diagnosis of facial deformations using AI systems based on intraoral and facial scanning will very likely be a field of increased interest in the future. The review is aimed at providing dental practitioners and interested colleagues in healthcare with a comprehensive understanding of the current trend of AI developments in the field of 3D imaging in dental medicine.

TI  - Evolution of Aesthetic Dentistry
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - One of the main goals of dental treatment is to mimic teeth and design smiles in a most natural and aesthetic manner, based on the individual and specific needs of the patient. Possibilities to reach that goal have significantly improved over the last decade through new and specific treatment modalities, steadily enhanced and more aesthetic dental materials, and novel techniques and technologies. This article gives an overview of the evolution of aesthetic dentistry over the past 100 y from a historical point of view and highlights advances in the development of dental research and clinical interventions that have contributed the science and art of aesthetic dentistry. Among the most noteworthy advancements over the past decade are the establishment of universal aesthetic rules and guidelines based on the assessment of natural aesthetic parameters, anatomy, and physiognomy; the development of tooth whitening and advanced restorative as well as prosthetic materials and techniques, supported by the pioneering discovery of dental adhesion; the significant progress in orthodontics and periodontal as well as oral and maxillofacial surgery; and, most recently, the implementation of digital technologies in the 3-dimensional planning and realization of truly natural, individual, and aesthetic smiles. In the future, artificial intelligence and machine learning will likely lead to automation of aesthetic evaluation, smile design, and treatment-planning processes.

TI  - Radiomics and Machine Learning in Oral Healthcare
T2  - PROTEOMICS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - The increasing storage of information, data, and forms of knowledge has led to the development of new technologies that can help to accomplish complex tasks in different areas, such as in dentistry. In this context, the role of computational methods, such as radiomics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, has been progressing remarkably for dentomaxillofacial radiology (DMFR). These tools bring new perspectives for diagnosis, classification, and prediction of oral diseases, treatment planning, and for the evaluation and prediction of outcomes, minimizing the possibilities of human errors. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of using radiomics and machine learning (ML) for imaging in oral healthcare is presented in this paper. Although the number of published studies is still relatively low, the preliminary results are very promising and in a near future, an augmented dentomaxillofacial radiology (ADMFR) will combine the use of radiomics-based and AI-based analyses with the radiologist's evaluation. In addition to the opportunities and possibilities, some challenges and limitations have also been discussed for further investigations.

TI  - Orthodontic Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Some Linear Dental Arch Measurements and Preventing Anterior Segment Malocclusion: A Prospective Study
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Orthodontics is a field that has seen significant advancements in recent years, with technology playing a crucial role in improving diagnosis and treatment planning. The study aimed to implement artificial intelligence to predict the arch width as a preventive measure to avoid future crowding in growing patients or even in adult patients seeking orthodontic treatment as a tool for orthodontic diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and fifty intraoral scan (IOS) images were selected from orthodontic patients seeking treatment in private orthodontic centers. Real inter-canine, inter-premolar, and inter-molar widths were measured digitally. Two of the main machine learning models were used: the Python programming language and machine learning algorithms, implementing the data on k-nearest neighbor and linear regression. Results: After the dataset had been implemented on the two ML algorithms, linear regression and k-nearest neighbor, the evaluation metric shows that KNN gives better prediction accuracy than LR does. The resulting accuracy was around 99%. Conclusions: it is possible to leverage machine learning to enhance orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning by predicting linear dental arch measurements and preventing anterior segment malocclusion.

TI  - Unlocking the Potential: Investigating Dental Practitioners' Willingness to Embrace Artificial Intelligence in Dental Practice
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for transforming healthcare delivery, including dentistry. However, the successful integration of AI into dental practice necessitates an understanding of dental professionals' perspectives, attitudes, and readiness to adopt AI technology. This study aimed to explore dental professionals' perceptions, attitudes, and practices regarding AI adoption in dentistry. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 256 dental professionals using an online questionnaire. Participants were assessed for familiarity with AI technology, perceived barriers to adoption, attitudes towards AI, current usage patterns, and factors influencing adoption decisions. Data are analysed using descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations. Inferential statistics, such as chi-square tests and regression analysis, were employed to examine associations between variables and identify predictors of AI adoption in dentistry. Results: The study surveyed 256 dental professionals from various regions across India, primarily aged 30 to 50 years (mean age: 42.6), with a nearly equal gender split (male: 48.4%, female: 51.6%) and high educational attainment (67.8% with master's or doctoral degrees). Private practices were predominant (56.3%). The diagnostic algorithms and treatment planning software were well known (77.3% and 70.3% familiarity, respectively). Technical concerns (average score: 3.82 +/- 0.68) were the main barriers to AI adoption, followed by financial considerations (average score: 3.45 +/- 0.72), ethical and legal issues (average score: 3.21 +/- 0.65), and organizational factors (average score: 3.67 +/- 0.71). Despite these concerns, most participants had positive attitudes towards AI (70.3% agreed). Current usage varied, with diagnostic support and administrative tasks being the most common (44.5% and 82.8% usage, respectively). Perceived utility (average score: 4.12 +/- 0.75) and ease of use (average score: 3.98 +/- 0.69) significantly influenced adoption, as identified by regression analysis (perceived utility: 13 = 0.342, p < 0.001; ease of use: 13 = 0.267, p = 0.005). Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into AI adoption in dentistry, highlighting the multifaceted nature of barriers and facilitators that influence dental professionals' adoption decisions. Strategies to promote AI adoption should address practical considerations, ethical concerns, and educational needs to facilitate the integration of AI technology into dental practices.

TI  - Applications and performance of artificial intelligence models in removable prosthodontics: A literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose: In this narrative review, we present the current applications and performances of artificial intelligence (AI) models in different phases of the removable prosthodontic workflow and related research topics. Study selection: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases between January 2010 and January 2023. Search terms related to AI were combined with terms related to removable prosthodontics. Articles reporting the structure and performance of the developed AI model were selected for this literature review. Results: A total of 15 articles were relevant to the application of AI in removable prosthodontics, including maxillofacial prosthetics. These applications included the design of removable partial dentures, classification of partially edentulous arches, functional evaluation and outcome prediction in complete denture treatment, early prosthetic management of patients with cleft lip and palate, coloration of maxillofacial prostheses, and prediction of the material properties of denture teeth. Various AI models with reliable prediction accuracy have been developed using supervised learning. Conclusions: The current applications of AI in removable prosthodontics exhibit significant potential for improving the prosthodontic workflow, with high accuracy levels reported in most of the reviewed studies. However, the focus has been predominantly on the diagnostic phase, with few studies addressing treatment planning and implementation. Because the number of AI-related studies in removable prosthodontics is limited, more models targeting different prosthodontic disciplines are required.

TI  - Deep Learning in Diagnosis of Dental Anomalies and Diseases: A Systematic Review
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Deep learning and diagnostic applications in oral and dental health have received significant attention recently. In this review, studies applying deep learning to diagnose anomalies and diseases in dental image material were systematically compiled, and their datasets, methodologies, test processes, explainable artificial intelligence methods, and findings were analyzed. Tests and results in studies involving human-artificial intelligence comparisons are discussed in detail to draw attention to the clinical importance of deep learning. In addition, the review critically evaluates the literature to guide and further develop future studies in this field. An extensive literature search was conducted for the 2019-May 2023 range using the Medline (PubMed) and Google Scholar databases to identify eligible articles, and 101 studies were shortlisted, including applications for diagnosing dental anomalies (n = 22) and diseases (n = 79) using deep learning for classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. According to the results, the most commonly used task type was classification (n = 51), the most commonly used dental image material was panoramic radiographs (n = 55), and the most frequently used performance metric was sensitivity/recall/true positive rate (n = 87) and accuracy (n = 69). Dataset sizes ranged from 60 to 12,179 images. Although deep learning algorithms are used as individual or at least individualized architectures, standardized architectures such as pre-trained CNNs, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and U-Net have been used in most studies. Few studies have used the explainable AI method (n = 22) and applied tests comparing human and artificial intelligence (n = 21). Deep learning is promising for better diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry based on the high-performance results reported by the studies. For all that, their safety should be demonstrated using a more reproducible and comparable methodology, including tests with information about their clinical applicability, by defining a standard set of tests and performance metrics.

TI  - Personalized workflows in reconstructive dentistry-current possibilities and future opportunities
T2  - CLINICAL ORAL INVESTIGATIONS
AB  - Objectives The increasing collection of health data coupled with continuous IT advances have enabled precision medicine with personalized workflows. Traditionally, dentistry has lagged behind general medicine in the integration of new technologies: So what is the status quo of precision dentistry? The primary focus of this review is to provide a current overview of personalized workflows in the discipline of reconstructive dentistry (prosthodontics) and to highlight the disruptive potential of novel technologies for dentistry; the possible impact on society is also critically discussed. Material and methods Narrative literature review. Results Narrative literature review. Conclusions In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI) will increase diagnostic accuracy, simplify treatment planning, and thus contribute to the development of personalized reconstructive workflows by analyzing e-health data to promote decision-making on an individual patient basis. Dental education will also benefit from AI systems for personalized curricula considering the individual students' skills. Augmented reality (AR) will facilitate communication with patients and improve clinical workflows through the use of visually guided protocols. Tele-dentistry will enable opportunities for remote contact among dental professionals and facilitate remote patient consultations and post-treatment follow-up using digital devices. Finally, a personalized digital dental passport encoded using blockchain technology could enable prosthetic rehabilitation using 3D-printed dental biomaterials. Clinical significance Overall, AI can be seen as the door-opener and driving force for the evolution from evidence-based prosthodontics to personalized reconstructive dentistry encompassing a synoptic approach with prosthetic and implant workflows. Nevertheless, ethical concerns need to be solved and international guidelines for data management and computing power must be established prior to a widespread routine implementation.

TI  - Digital Decision Making in Dentistry: Analysis and Prediction of Periodontitis Using Machine Learning Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
AB  - Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the powerful weapons of Artificial Intelligence plays crucial role and major contributions in almost all the sectors using sophisticated technological framework with an insight to unlock the needs of business enacting decisions where data patterns holds a main role right from data gathering and explorations to visualization and predictions. Recently it is also a predominating technology used vigorously in various health sectors like medical, dental and allied health services as an aid to develop tools for decision making in data analytics and exploration, disease prediction and control, data analytics and treatment planning. Major research on this area was done in past contributing good frameworks for the predictions of Breast cancer, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoporosis, Diabetes, Sarcoidosis, Graves' disease, AIDS, Psoriasis and many more. The current research paper is a result of using such Machine Learning approaches for the prediction of Periodontitis, a most common gum disease which leads to severe complications like tooth supporting structure loss like bone loss around tooth, ligament loss and finally the tooth loss if left untreated. In the current paper, a dataset size of 206 records of diabetic and non-diabetic periodontitis patients were collected with the measurable parameters like age, sex, oral hygienic status, tooth mobility, periodontal index, gingival index, furcation, alveolar bone loss, pocket depth and other parameters were taken and implemented. Supervised machine learning algorithms for classification like Support vector machine, Naive Bayes, Random forest, Logistic regression, decision tree and K Nearest neighbor algorithms were used and implemented in python using jupyter notebook for the prediction of periodontitis and obtained accuracies of 96.7%, 95.1%, 96.7%, 93.5%, 96.7% and 98.3% respectively. The current paper demonstrates how the dataset was collected and implemented using Machine learning approach in dentistry for obtaining a suggestible predictable model for periodontitis also compares all the models mentioned for their efficiency and accuracies.

TI  - Performance of a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Automatic Cephalometric Landmark Detection
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an artificial intelligence model to detect cephalometric landmark automatically enabling the automatic analysis of cephalometric radiographs which have a very important place in dental practice and is used routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of dental and skeletal disorders.
   Methods: In this study, 1620 lateral cephalograms were obtained and 21 landmarks were included. The coordinates of all landmarks in the 1620 films were obtained to establish a labeled data set: 1360 were used as a training set, 140 as a validation set, and 180 as a testing set. A convolutional neural network-based artificial intelligence algorithm for automatic cephalometric landmark detection was developed. Mean radial error and success detection rate within the range of 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm were used to evaluate the performance of the model.
   Results: Presented artificial intelligence system (CranioCatch, Eskisehir, Turkey) could detect 21 anatomic landmarks in a lateral cephalometric radiograph. The highest success detection rate scores of 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm were obtained from the sella point as 98.3, 99.4, 99.4, and 99.4, respectively. The mean radial error +/- standard deviation value of the sella point was found as 0.616 +/- 0.43. The lowest success detection rate scores of 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm were obtained from the Gonion point as 48.3, 62.8, 73.9, and 87.2, respectively. The mean radial error +/- standard deviation value of Gonion point was found as 8.304 +/- 2.98.
   Conclusion: Although the success of the automatic landmark detection using the developed artificial intelligence model was not insufficient for clinical use, artificial intelligence-based cephalometric analysis systems seem promising to cephalometric analysis which provides a basis for diagnosis, treatment planning, and following-up in clinical orthodontics practice.

AB  - Background: Biomedical research has recently moved through three stages in digital healthcare: (1) data collection; (2) data sharing; and (3) data analytics. With the explosion of stored health data (HD), dental medicine is edging into its fourth stage of digitization using artificial intelligence (AI). This narrative literature review outlines the challenge of managing HD and anticipating the potential of AI in oral healthcare and dental research by summarizing the current literature. Summary: The basis of successful management of HD is the establishment of a generally accepted data standard that will guide its implementation within electronic health records (EHR) and health information technology ecosystems (HIT Eco). Thereby continuously adapted (self-) learning health systems (LHS) can be created. The HIT Eco of the future will combine (i) the front-end utilization of HD in clinical decision-making by providers using supportive diagnostic tools for patient-centered treatment planning, and (ii) back-end algorithms analyzing the standardized collected data to inform population-based policy decisions about resource allocations and research directions. Cryptographic methods in blockchain enable a safe, more efficient, and effective dental care within a global perspective. Key Message: The interoperability of HD with accessible digital health technologies is the key to deliver value-based dental care and exploit the tremendous potential of AI.

TI  - Automated Skeletal Classification with Lateral Cephalometry Based on Artificial Intelligence
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Lateral cephalometry has been widely used for skeletal classification in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this conventional system, requiring manual tracing of individual landmarks, contains possible errors of inter- and intravariability and is highly time-consuming. This study aims to provide an accurate and robust skeletal diagnostic system by incorporating a convolutional neural network (CNN) into a 1-step, end-to-end diagnostic system with lateral cephalograms. A multimodal CNN model was constructed on the basis of 5,890 lateral cephalograms and demographic data as an input. The model was optimized with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. Diagnostic performance was evaluated with statistical analysis. The proposed system exhibited >90% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for vertical and sagittal skeletal diagnosis. Clinical performance of the vertical classification showed the highest accuracy at 96.40 (95% CI, 93.06 to 98.39; model III). The receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve both demonstrated the excellent performance of the system, with a mean area under the curve >95%. The heat maps of cephalograms were also provided for deeper understanding of the quality of the learned model by visually representing the region of the cephalogram that is most informative in distinguishing skeletal classes. In addition, we present broad applicability of this system through subtasks. The proposed CNN-incorporated system showed potential for skeletal orthodontic diagnosis without the need for intermediary steps requiring complicated diagnostic procedures.

TI  - Automatic dental age calculation from panoramic radiographs using deep learning: a two-stage approach with object detection and image classification
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundDental age is crucial for treatment planning in pediatric and orthodontic dentistry. Dental age calculation methods can be categorized into morphological, biochemical, and radiological methods. Radiological methods are commonly used because they are non-invasive and reproducible. When radiographs are available, dental age can be calculated by evaluating the developmental stage of permanent teeth and converting it into an estimated age using a table, or by measuring the length between some landmarks such as the tooth, root, or pulp, and substituting them into regression formulas. However, these methods heavily depend on manual time-consuming processes. In this study, we proposed a novel and completely automatic dental age calculation method using panoramic radiographs and deep learning techniques.MethodsOverall, 8,023 panoramic radiographs were used as training data for Scaled-YOLOv4 to detect dental germs and mean average precision were evaluated. In total, 18,485 single-root and 16,313 multi-root dental germ images were used as training data for EfficientNetV2 M to classify the developmental stages of detected dental germs and Top-3 accuracy was evaluated since the adjacent stages of the dental germ looks similar and the many variations of the morphological structure can be observed between developmental stages. Scaled-YOLOv4 and EfficientNetV2 M were trained using cross-validation. We evaluated a single selection, a weighted average, and an expected value to convert the probability of developmental stage classification to dental age. One hundred and fifty-seven panoramic radiographs were used to compare automatic and manual human experts' dental age calculations.ResultsDental germ detection was achieved with a mean average precision of 98.26% and dental germ classifiers for single and multi-root were achieved with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.46% and 98.36%, respectively. The mean absolute errors between the automatic and manual dental age calculations using single selection, weighted average, and expected value were 0.274, 0.261, and 0.396, respectively. The weighted average was better than the other methods and was accurate by less than one developmental stage error.ConclusionOur study demonstrates the feasibility of automatic dental age calculation using panoramic radiographs and a two-stage deep learning approach with a clinically acceptable level of accuracy.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence for Fast and Accurate 3-Dimensional Tooth Segmentation on Cone-beam Computed Tomography
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDODONTICS
AB  - Introduction: Tooth segmentation on cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) imaging is a labor-intensive task considering the limited contrast resolution and potential disturbance by various artifacts. Fully automated tooth segmentation cannot be achieved by merely relying on CBCT intensity variations. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tool for automated tooth segmentation on CBCT imaging. Methods: A total of 433 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine images of single-and double-rooted teeth randomly selected from 314 anonymized CBCT scans were imported and manually segmented. An AI-driven tooth segmentation algorithm based on a feature pyramid network was developed to automatically detect and segment teeth, replacing manual user contour placement. The AI-driven tool was evaluated based on volume comparison, intersection over union, the Dice score coefficient, morphologic surface deviation, and total segmentation time. Results: Overall, AI-driven and clinical reference segmentations resulted in very similar segmentation volumes. The mean intersection over union for full-tooth segmentation was 0.87 (?0.03) and 0.88 (?0.03) for semiautomated (SA) (clinical reference) versus fully automated AI-driven (F-AI) and refined AI-driven (R-AI) tooth segmentation, respectively. R-AI and F-AI segmentation showed an average median surface deviation from SA segmentation of 9.96 mm (?59.33 mm) and 7.85 mm (?69.55 mm), respectively. SA segmentations of single and double-rooted teeth had a mean total time of 6.6 minutes (?76.15 seconds), F-AI segmentation of 0.5 minutes (?8.64 seconds, 12 times faster), and R-AI segmentation of 1.2 minutes (?33.02 seconds, 6 times faster). Conclusions: This study showed a unique fast and accurate approach for AI-driven automated tooth segmentation on CBCT imaging. These results may open doors for AI-driven applications in surgical and treatment planning in oral health care. (J Endod 2021;47:827?835.)

TI  - Application of deep machine learning for the radiographic diagnosis of periodontitis
T2  - CLINICAL ORAL INVESTIGATIONS
AB  - Objective Successful application of deep machine learning could reduce time-consuming and labor-intensive clinical work of calculating the amount of radiographic bone loss (RBL) in diagnosing and treatment planning for periodontitis. This study aimed to test the accuracy of RBL classification by machine learning.
   Materials and methods A total of 236 patients with standardized full mouth radiographs were included. Each tooth from the periapical films was evaluated by three calibrated periodontists for categorization of RBL and radiographic defect morphology. Each image was pre-processed and augmented to ensure proper data balancing without data pollution, then a novel multitasking InceptionV3 model was applied.
   Results The model demonstrated an average accuracy of 0.87 +/- 0.01 in the categorization of mild (< 15%) or severe (>= 15%) bone loss with fivefold cross-validation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of the model were 0.86 +/- 0.03, 0.88 +/- 0.03, 0.88 +/- 0.03, and 0.86 +/- 0.02, respectively.
   Conclusions Application of deep machine learning for the detection of alveolar bone loss yielded promising results in this study. Additional data would be beneficial to enhance model construction and enable better machine learning performance for clinical implementation.
   Clinical relevance Higher accuracy of radiographic bone loss classification by machine learning can be achieved with more clinical data and proper model construction for valuable clinical application.

TI  - Detection of periodontal bone loss patterns and furcation defects from panoramic radiographs using deep learning algorithm: a retrospective study
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundThis retrospective study aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm for the interpretation of panoramic radiographs and to examine the performance of this algorithm in the detection of periodontal bone losses and bone loss patterns.MethodsA total of 1121 panoramic radiographs were used in this study. Bone losses in the maxilla and mandibula (total alveolar bone loss) (n = 2251), interdental bone losses (n = 25303), and furcation defects (n = 2815) were labeled using the segmentation method. In addition, interdental bone losses were divided into horizontal (n = 21839) and vertical (n = 3464) bone losses according to the defect patterns. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based artificial intelligence (AI) system was developed using U-Net architecture. The performance of the deep learning algorithm was statistically evaluated by the confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis.ResultsThe system showed the highest diagnostic performance in the detection of total alveolar bone losses (AUC = 0.951) and the lowest in the detection of vertical bone losses (AUC = 0.733). The sensitivity, precision, F1 score, accuracy, and AUC values were found as 1, 0.995, 0.997, 0.994, 0.951 for total alveolar bone loss; found as 0.947, 0.939, 0.943, 0.892, 0.910 for horizontal bone losses; found as 0.558, 0.846, 0.673, 0.506, 0.733 for vertical bone losses and found as 0.892, 0.933, 0.912, 0.837, 0.868 for furcation defects (respectively).ConclusionsAI systems offer promising results in determining periodontal bone loss patterns and furcation defects from dental radiographs. This suggests that CNN algorithms can also be used to provide more detailed information such as automatic determination of periodontal disease severity and treatment planning in various dental radiographs.

TI  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH NEURAL NETWORK MACHINE LEARNING MAY ASSIST DECISION-MAKING FOR EXTRACTIONS IN ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT PLANNING
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED DENTAL PRACTICE
AB  - Subjects
   The sample consisted of a data set of 12 cephalometric variables and additional 6 indices, collected from 156 orthodontic patients (learning set, n=96; test set, n=60).
   Key exposure/study factor
   Subject selection
   1) Exclusion criteria included those who exhibited unerupted permanent teeth or missing teeth (except for third molars), malformed teeth, previous histories of orthodontic treatment and/or orthognathic surgery, and the presence of maxillofacial deformities.
   2) Inclusion criteria included those who were judged as in need of undertaking one of the following 5 treatment plans, ie, nonextraction, maxillary and mandibular first premolar extractions (Ext_type_44-44), maxillary and mandibular second premolar extractions (Ext_type_55-55), maxillary first premolar and mandibular second premolar extractions (Ext_type_44-55), and maxillary first premolar extractions only (Ext_type_44-00).
   3) For all subjects, the treatment plans were determined by 1 orthodontic specialist.
   Feature elements used in prediction modeling
   1) Lateral cephalometric measures-12 variables that characterized the sagittal and vertical jaw relationships, incisor inclinations, and soft tissue profiles are ANB angle, overjet, Bjork sum, overbite, maxillary central incisor to SN angle, maxillary central incisor to occlusal plane angle, IMPA, mandibular central lip to E-line, lower lip to E-line, and nasolabial angle.
   2) Additional 6 measures-the maxillary arch length discrepancy index, the mandibular arch length discrepancy index, the molar key index, the large overjet index, the protrusion index, and the chief complaint for protrusion index. Multimodal elements should be clarified.
   Calculation cut-off criterion
   Iterative learning was stopped at the minimum error point of the validation set to prevent overfitting.
   Output data
   1) The extraction patterns for premolar teeth were sub-categorized into 1 of the following 3 bits:
   (a) Dx_ext-whether or not the extractions were needed.
   (b) Dx_diff-whether differential extractions between the maxillary and mandibular arches were needed or not.
   (c) Dx_more-whether more retraction of anterior teeth was needed.
   2) For comparison with an actual diagnosis, the decision-making success rates of Dx_ext, Dx_diff, and Dx_more were calculated. Finally, the total success rate of the system's recommendations for extractions was calculated.
   Main outcome measure
   In the judgment of requiring extraction vs nonextraction of premolars for orthodontic treatment, the decision-making success rates were 92% in the training set, 94% in the validation set, 93% in the test set, and 93% in total. In the judgment of identical vs differential extraction, the success rates were 88% in the training set, 100% in the validation set, 85% in the test set, and 89% in total. In the judgment of more retraction in identical extraction, the success rates were 88% in the training set, 75% in the validation set, 85% in the test set, and 84% in total. In the decicion-making of more retraction in differential extraction, the success rates were 95% in the training set, 100% in the validation set, 95% in the test set, and 96% in total. Through the sequential application of decision-making models, the final success rates were 85% in the learning set, 82% in the test set, and 84% in total.
   Six cases were reversed between Ext_type_55-55 and nonextraction. In the 25 cases of failed diagnosis, unacceptable decisions were found in 4 cases. The decisions for the other cases were acceptable because they were borderline.
   Conclusions
   The authors concluded that the success rates of the models were 93% for the system's recommendations for extraction vs nonextraction and 84% for the detailed recommendations for the extraction patterns. It was suggested that artificial intelligence expert systems with neural network machine learning could be useful in orthodontics and that improved performance was achieved by components such as proper selection of the input data, appropriate organization of the modeling, and preferable generalization.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence for radiographic image analysis
T2  - SEMINARS IN ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Automated identification of landmarks on lateral cephalogram and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans can save time for the clinicians and act as a second set of eyes for analysis of radiographic images in diagno-sis and treatment planning. Several machine-learning techniques have been utilized for this purpose with varying accuracies. However, high degree of variability in the clinical presentation of orthodontic patients, limitations of the algorithms, lack of labelled data, high compute power, etc. are some drawbacks that have limited robust clinical application of such techniques. In recent years, artificial neural networks like deep learning and more specifi-cally deep neural networks are making significant inroads in the true adop-tion of this technology. YOLOv3 and Single Shot Multibox Detector are some of the deep learning algorithms that have shown promising results. This paper is a theoretical review of the evolution of these technologies and the current state of the art in orthodontic image analysis. (Semin Orthod 2021; 27:109-120) Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Three-dimensional digital applications for implant space planning in orthodontics: A narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE WORLD FEDERATION OF ORTHODONTISTS
AB  - In the digital dentistry era, new tools, algorithms, data science approaches, and computer applications are available to researchers and clinicians. However, there is also a strong need for better knowledge and understanding of multisource data applications, including three-dimensional imaging information such as cone-beam computed tomography images and digital dental models for multidisciplinary cases. In addition, artificial intelligence models and automated clinical decision systems are rising. The clinician needs to plan the treatment based on state-of-the-art diagnosis for better and more personalized treatment. This article aimed to review basic concepts and the current panorama of digital implant planning in orthodontics, with open-source and closed-source tools for assessing cone-beam computed images and digital dental models. The visualization and processing of the three-dimensional data allow better implant planning based on bone conditions, adjacent teeth and root positions, and the prognosis of the case. We showed that many tools for assessment, segmentation, and visualization of cone-beam computed tomographic images and digital dental models could facilitate the treatment planning of patients needing implants or space closure. The tools and approaches presented are toward personalized treatment and better prognosis, following the path to a more automated clinical decision system based on multisource three-dimensional data, artificial intelligence models, and digital planning. In summary, the orthodontist needs to analyze each patient individually and use different software or tools that better fit their practice, allowing efficient treatment planning and satisfactory results with an adequate prognosis.

TI  - A comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for dental diagnosis and charting
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to develop artificial intelligence (AI) guided framework to recognize tooth numbers in panoramic and intraoral radiographs (periapical and bitewing) without prior domain knowledge and arrange the intraoral radiographs into a full mouth series (FMS) arrangement template. This model can be integrated with different diseases diagnosis models, such as periodontitis or caries, to facilitate clinical examinations and diagnoses. Methods The framework utilized image segmentation models to generate the masks of bone area, tooth, and cementoenamel junction (CEJ) lines from intraoral radiographs. These masks were used to detect and extract teeth bounding boxes utilizing several image analysis methods. Then, individual teeth were matched with a patient's panoramic images (if available) or tooth repositories for assigning tooth numbers using the multi-scale matching strategy. This framework was tested on 1240 intraoral radiographs different from the training and internal validation cohort to avoid data snooping. Besides, a web interface was designed to generate a report for different dental abnormalities with tooth numbers to evaluate this framework's practicality in clinical settings. Results The proposed method achieved the following precision and recall via panoramic view: 0.96 and 0.96 (via panoramic view) and 0.87 and 0.87 (via repository match) by handling tooth shape variation and outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed framework could accurately arrange a set of intraoral radiographs into an FMS arrangement template based on positions and tooth numbers with an accuracy of 95% for periapical images and 90% for bitewing images. The accuracy of this framework was also 94% in the images with missing teeth and 89% with restorations. Conclusions The proposed tooth numbering model is robust and self-contained and can also be integrated with other dental diagnosis modules, such as alveolar bone assessment and caries detection. This artificial intelligence-based tooth detection and tooth number assignment in dental radiographs will help dentists with enhanced communication, documentation, and treatment planning accurately. In addition, the proposed framework can correctly specify detailed diagnostic information associated with a single tooth without human intervention.

TI  - Accurate gingival segmentation from 3D images with artificial intelligence: an animal pilot study
T2  - PROGRESS IN ORTHODONTICS
AB  - BackgroundGingival phenotype plays an important role in dental diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditionally, determining the gingival phenotype is done by manual probing of the gingival soft tissues, an invasive and time-consuming procedure. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of an alternatively novel, non-invasive technology based on the precise 3-dimension (3D) soft tissue reconstruction from intraoral scanning and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to predict the gingival biotype.MethodsAs a proof-of-concept, Yorkshire pig mandibles were scanned, and the CBCT data were fed into a deep-learning model to reconstruct the teeth and surrounding bone structure in 3D. By overlaying the CBCT scan with the intraoral scans, an accurate superposition was created and used for virtual measurements of the soft tissue thickness. Meanwhile, gingival thicknesses were also measured by a periodontal probe and digital caliper on the buccal and lingual sides at 3 mm apical to the gingival margin of the posterior teeth and compared with the virtual assessment at the same location. The data obtained from virtual and clinical measurements were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank analysis, while their correlation was determined by Pearson's r value. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons of the amount of difference.ResultsAmong 108 investigated locations, the clinical and virtual measurements are strongly positively correlated (r = 0.9656, P < 0.0001), and only clinically insignificant differences (0.066 +/- 0.223 mm) were observed between the two assessments. There is no difference in the agreement between the virtual and clinical measurements on sexually matured samples (0.087 +/- 0.240 mm) and pre-pubertal samples (0.033 +/- 0.195 mm). Noticeably, there is a greater agreement between the virtual and clinical measurements at the buccal sites (0.019 +/- 0.233 mm) than at the lingual sites (0.116 +/- 0.215 mm).ConclusionIn summary, the artificial intelligence-based virtual measurement proposed in this work provides an innovative technique potentially for accurately measuring soft tissue thickness using clinical routine 3D imaging systems, which will aid clinicians in generating a more comprehensive diagnosis with less invasive procedures and, in turn, optimize the treatment plans with more predictable outcomes.

TI  - The use of artificial intelligence to aid in oral hygiene education: A scoping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in constant, non-invasive monitoring of daily oral hygiene practices, potentially on behalf of a dentist or healthcare provider. This review summarises the evidence around the use of AI in the context of oral hygiene education. Data & sources: This scoping review was developed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review protocol guidelines and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Publications that involved the use of AI for oral hygiene education in any population and setting were included. A systematic electronic database search (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore, arXiv, Proquest, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PROSPERO) up to, and including 4 February 2023 was carried out. Citation searching from the full-text of included publications was also performed. Results: Of the 3215 publications screened, 20 were selected for qualitative synthesis. These were broadly divided into two categories of AI-assisted feedback: (1) synchronous and (2) asynchronous monitoring. There is a lack of high-quality studies, scarce reflection on possible ethical concerns on AI, and of studies comparing qualitative feedback to quantitative clinical outcomes with a control. Barriers to adoption of AI technologies, patient pri-vacy, and specific areas for improvement were identified. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the use of AI to modify oral hygiene behaviour is promising. Further work is required in generating higher quality intra-oral images for dental biofilm detection, and in developing more personalised feedback for users. Clinical significance: This is the first review to map out the available literature on AI in providing oral hygiene education. It may be useful to dental researchers in appraising AI-assisted technologies in the context of oral health.

TI  - With or without human interference for precise age estimation based on machine learning?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
AB  - Age estimation can aid in forensic medicine applications, diagnosis, and treatment planning for orthodontics and pediatrics. Existing dental age estimation methods rely heavily on specialized knowledge and are highly subjective, wasting time, and energy, which can be perfectly solved by machine learning techniques. As the key factor affecting the performance of machine learning models, there are usually two methods for feature extraction: human interference and autonomous extraction without human interference. However, previous studies have rarely applied these two methods for feature extraction in the same image analysis task. Herein, we present two types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dental age estimation. One is an automated dental stage evaluation model (ADSE model) based on specified manually defined features, and the other is an automated end-to-end dental age estimation model (ADAE model), which autonomously extracts potential features for dental age estimation. Although the mean absolute error (MAE) of the ADSE model for stage classification is 0.17 stages, its accuracy in dental age estimation is unsatisfactory, with the MAE (1.63 years) being only 0.04 years lower than the manual dental age estimation method (MDAE model). However, the MAE of the ADAE model is 0.83 years, being reduced by half that of the MDAE model. The results show that fully automated feature extraction in a deep learning model without human interference performs better in dental age estimation, prominently increasing the accuracy and objectivity. This indicates that without human interference, machine learning may perform better in the application of medical imaging.

TI  - Deep Learning for Dental Diagnosis: A Novel Approach to Furcation Involvement Detection on Periapical Radiographs
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB  - Furcation defects pose a significant challenge in the diagnosis and treatment planning of periodontal diseases. The accurate detection of furcation involvements (FI) on periapical radiographs (PAs) is crucial for the success of periodontal therapy. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach to furcation defect detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an accuracy rate of 95%. This research has undergone a rigorous review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has received accreditation under number 202002030B0C505. A dataset of 300 periapical radiographs of teeth with and without FI were collected and preprocessed to enhance the quality of the images. The efficient and innovative image masking technique used in this research better enhances the contrast between FI symptoms and other areas. Moreover, this technology highlights the region of interest (ROI) for the subsequent CNN models training with a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. The proposed segmentation algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance with an overall accuracy up to 94.97%, surpassing other conventional methods. Moreover, in comparison with existing CNN technology for identifying dental problems, this research proposes an improved adaptive threshold preprocessing technique that produces clearer distinctions between teeth and interdental molars. The proposed model achieves impressive results in detecting FI with identification rates ranging from 92.96% to a remarkable 94.97%. These findings suggest that our deep learning approach holds significant potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of dental diagnosis. Such AI-assisted dental diagnosis has the potential to improve periodontal diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. This research demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using deep learning algorithms for furcation defect detection on periapical radiographs and highlights the potential for AI-assisted dental diagnosis. With the improvement of dental abnormality detection, earlier intervention could be enabled and could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Three-dimensional Computer-aided Design System used in Orthodontics and Orthognathic Surgery for Diagnosis and Treatment Planning- A Narrative Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Three dimensional advancements in technology have made a profound impact on various fields, and dentistry, particularly the branch of orthodontics and orthognathic surgeries, which has not been exempt from this transformative influence. Among the cuttingedge technologies that have gained significant traction is Three-Dimensional (3D) printing, which has found its initial applications in orthodontics for producing dental casts. By integrating intraoral scanners, dentists now possess the remarkable ability to obtain dental impressions without subjecting patients to the discomfort associated with traditional methods. Furthermore, 3D planning techniques have emerged as a pivotal element in orthodontics, especially when striving for optimal aesthetic and occlusal outcomes. Precise treatment planning plays a vital role in ensuring successful orthognathic surgeries and other orthodontic interventions. The utilisation of 3D planning techniques facilitates the gathering of comprehensive data, thereby achieving two main objectives: an accurate diagnosis of the dentoskeletal deformity and the formulation of a treatment plan that can be faithfully replicated during the clinical procedure. Even 3D imaging technology, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), has become an indispensable tool in dentistry. These imaging techniques provide volumetric images of a patient's facial anatomy, enabling the transformation of intricate details into precise 3D representations of the craniofacial skeleton and soft tissue layers. Consequently, this progress has led to the development of computerised resources dedicated to preoperative planning and the fabrication of surgical splints. The integration of advanced technologies, including 3D printing, 3D planning techniques, and 3D imaging technology, has revolutionised orthodontics, providing dentists with precise tools for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and ultimately, enhanced patient care. As this field continues to progress, the potential for further advancements and innovative applications utilising artificial intelligence becomes an exciting prospect in the ever-evolving landscape of modern dentistry.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach to Uncovering Hidden Utilization Patterns of Early Childhood Dental Care Among Medicaid-Insured Children
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Early childhood dental care (ECDC) is a significant public health opportunity since dental caries is largely preventable and a prime target for reducing healthcare expenditures. This study aims to discover underlying patterns in ECDC utilization among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, which have significant implications for public health prevention, innovative service delivery models, and targeted cost-saving interventions.
   Methods: Using 9 years of longitudinal Medicaid data of 24,223 publicly insured child members of an accountable care organization (ACO), Partners for Kids in Ohio, we applied unsupervised machine learning to cluster patients based on their cumulative dental cost curves in early childhood (24-60 months). Clinical validity, analytical validity, and reproducibility were assessed.
   Results: The clustering revealed five novel subpopulations: (1) early-onset of decay by age (0.5% of the population, as early as 28 months), (2) middle-onset of decay (3.0%, as early as 35 months), (3) late-onset of decay (5.8%, as early as 44 months), (4) regular preventive care (67.7%), and (5) zero utilization (23.0%). Patients with early-onset of decay incurred the highest dental cost [median annual cost (MAC) = $9,499, InterQuartile Range (IQR): $7,052-$11,216], while patients with regular preventive care incurred the lowest dental cost (MAC = $191, IQR: $99-$336). We also found a plausible correlation of early-onset of decay with complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0-24 months. Almost one-third of patients with early-onset of decay had complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0-24 months. Patients with early-onset of decay also incurred the highest medical cost (MAC = $7,513, IQR: $4,527-$12,546) at 0-24 months.
   Conclusion: Among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, five subpopulations with distinctive clinical, cost, and utilization patterns were discovered and validated through a data-driven approach. This novel discovery promotes innovative prevention strategies that differentiate Medicaid subpopulations, and allows for the development of cost-effective interventions that target high-risk patients. Furthermore, an integrated medical-dental care delivery model promises to reduce costs further while improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Automated detection of dental restorations using deep learning on panoramic radiographs
T2  - DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: Automatically detecting dental conditions using Artificial intelligence (AI) and reporting it visually are now a need for treatment planning and dental health management. This work presents a comprehensive computer -aided detection system to detect dental resto-rations.Methods: The state -of -art ten different deep-learning detection models were used including R -CNN, Faster R -CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and RetinaNet as detectors. ResNet- 50, ResNet- 101, XCeption- 101, VGG16, and DarkNet53 were integrated as backbone and feature extractor in addition to efficient approaches such Side -Aware Boundary Localization, cascaded structures and simple model frameworks like Libra and Dynamic.Total 684 objects in panoramic radiographs were used to detect available three classes, namely, dental restorations, denture and implant.Each model was evaluated by mean average precision (mAP), average recall (AR), and precision -recall curve using Common Objects in Context (COCO) detection evaluation metrics.Results: mAP varied between 0.755 and 0.973 for ten models explored while AR ranges between 0.605 and 0.771. Faster R -CNN RegnetX provided the best detection performance with mAP of 0.973 and AR of 0.771. Area under precision -recall curve was 0.952. Precision -recall curve indicated that errors were mainly dominated by localization confusions.Conclusions: Results showed that the proposed AI -based computer -aided system had great potential with reliable, accurate performance detecting dental restorations, denture and implant in panoramic radiographs. As training models with more data and standardization in reporting, AI -based solutions will be implemented to dental clinics for daily use soon.

TI  - Machine Learning in Predicting Tooth Loss: A Systematic Review and Risk of Bias Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB  - Predicting tooth loss is a persistent clinical challenge in the 21st century. While an emerging field in dentistry, computational solutions that employ machine learning are promising for enhancing clinical outcomes, including the chairside prognostication of tooth loss. We aimed to evaluate the risk of bias in prognostic prediction models of tooth loss that use machine learning. To do this, literature was searched in two electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed; Google Scholar) for studies that reported the accuracy or area under the curve (AUC) of prediction models. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds. Although both development and validation were included in this review, studies that did not assess the accuracy or validation of boosting models (AdaBoosting, Gradient-boosting decision tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were excluded. Five studies met criteria for inclusion and revealed high accuracy; however, models displayed a high risk of bias. Importantly, patient-level assessments combined with socioeconomic predictors performed better than clinical predictors alone. While there are current limitations, machine-learning-assisted models for tooth loss may enhance prognostication accuracy in combination with clinical and patient metadata in the future.

TI  - Facial Scanners in Dentistry: An Overview
T2  - PROSTHESIS
AB  - Purpose: This narrative review aims to explore the current status of facial scanning technology in the dental field; outlining the history, mechanisms, and current evidence regarding its use and limitations within digital dentistry. Methods: Subtopics within facial scanner technology in dentistry were identified and divided among four reviewers. Electronic searches of the Medline (PubMed) database were performed with the following search terms: facial scanner, dentistry, prosthodontics, virtual patient, sleep apnea, maxillofacial prosthetics, accuracy. For this review only studies or review papers evaluating facial scanning technology for dental or medical applications were included. A total of 44 articles were included. Due to the narrative nature of this review, no formal evidence-based quality assessment was performed and the search was limited to the English language. No further restrictions were applied. Results: The significance, applications, limitations, and future directions of facial scanning technology were reviewed. Specific subtopics include significant history of facial scanner use and development for dentistry, different types and mechanisms used in facial scanning technology, accuracy of scanning technology, use as a diagnostic tool, use in creating a virtual patient, virtual articulation, smile design, diagnosing and treating obstructive sleep apnea, limitations of scanning technology, and future directions with artificial intelligence. Conclusions: Despite limitations in scan quality and software operation, 3D facial scanners are rapid and non-invasive tools that can be utilized in multiple facets of dental care. Facial scanners can serve an invaluable role in the digital workflow by capturing facial records to facilitate interdisciplinary communication, virtual articulation, smile design, and obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment. Looking into the future, facial scanning technology has promising applications in the fields of craniofacial research, and prosthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.

TI  - Two-Stage Mesh Deep Learning for Automated Tooth Segmentation and Landmark Localization on 3D Intraoral Scans
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB  - Accurately segmenting teeth and identifying the corresponding anatomical landmarks on dental mesh models are essential in computer-aided orthodontic treatment. Manually performing these two tasks is time-consuming, tedious, and, more importantly, highly dependent on orthodontists' experiences due to the abnormality and large-scale variance of patients' teeth. Some machine learning-based methods have been designed and applied in the orthodontic field to automatically segment dental meshes (e.g., intraoral scans). In contrast, the number of studies on tooth landmark localization is still limited. This paper proposes a two stage framework based on mesh deep learning (called TS-MDL) for joint tooth labeling and landmark identification on raw intraoral scans. Our TS-MDL first adopts an end-to-end iMeshSegNet method (i.e., a variant of the existing MeshSegNet with both improved accuracy and efficiency) to label each tooth on the downsampled scan. Guided by the segmentation outputs, our TS-MDL further selects each tooth's region of interest (ROI) on the original mesh to construct a light-weight variant of the pioneering PointNet (i.e., PointNet-Reg) for regressing the corresponding landmark heatmaps. Our TS-MDL was evaluated on a real-clinical dataset, showing promising segmentation and localization performance. Specifically, iMeshSegNet in the first stage of TS-MDL reached an averaged Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) at 0.964 +/- 0.054, significantly outperforming the original MeshSegNet. In the second stage, PointNet-Reg achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.597 +/- 0.761 mm in distances between the prediction and ground truth for 66 landmarks, which is superior compared with other networks for landmark detection. All these results suggest the potential usage of our TS-MDL in orthodontics.

TI  - The validation of orthodontic artificial intelligence systems that perform orthodontic diagnoses and treatment planning
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Aim This study was aimed to evaluate two artificial intelligence (AI) systems that created a prioritized problem list and treatment plan, and examine whether the performance of the aforementioned systems was equivalent to orthodontists. Materials and methods A total of 967 consecutive cases [800: training; 67: validation; 100: evaluation (40: randomly selected for the clinical evaluation)] were used. We used a stored document that describes (1) the patient's clinical information, (2) the prioritized list, and (3) a treatment strategy without digital tooth movement. Sentences of (1) were vectorized according to the bag of words method (V); sentences of (2) and (3) were relabelled with 423 and 330 labels, respectively. AI systems that output labels for the prioritized list (subtask 1) and treatment planning (subtask 2) based on the vectors V were developed using a support vector machine and self-attention network, respectively, while the system was trained to improve precision and recall. Clinical evaluations were conducted by four orthodontists (no faculty or residents; peer group) in two sessions: in the first session, peer group and the developed AI systems created problem lists and treatment plans; in the second session, two of the peer group (not AI) evaluated these lists and plans, including the lists and plans of the AIs, by scoring them using 4-point scales [unacceptable (1) to ideal (4)]. Scores were compared among the system and peer group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.05). Results The precision after system training was 65% and 48% for subtasks 1 and 2 respectively, with recall of 55% and 48%, respectively. The clinical evaluation of the AI system for subtask 1 showed a mid-rank. For subtask 2, the AI system had a significantly lower score than the three panels but the same rank with one panel. Conclusions Two AI systems that output a prioritized problem list and create a treatment plan were developed. The clinical system ability of the former system showed a mid-rank in the peer group, and the latter system was almost equivalent to the worst orthodontist.

TI  - Tooth Defect Segmentation in 3D Mesh Scans Using Deep Learning
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, CICAI 2022, PT III
CP  - 2nd CAAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CICAI)
AB  - Computer-aided systems are widely used in digital dentistry to help human experts for accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, we study the problem of tooth defect segmentation in 3-Dimensional (3D) mesh scans, which is a prerequisite task in many dental applications. Existing models usually perform poorly in this task due to the highly imbalanced characteristic of tooth defects. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel triple-stream graph convolutional network named TripleNet to learn multi-scale geometric features from mesh scans for end-to-end tooth defect segmentation. With predefined geometrical features as inputs and a focal loss for training guidance, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on 3D tooth defect segmentation. Our work exhibits the great potential of artificial intelligence for future digital dentistry.

TI  - Evaluation of artificial intelligence model for crowding categorization and extraction diagnosis using intraoral photographs
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Determining the severity of dental crowding and the necessity of tooth extraction for orthodontic treatment planning are time-consuming processes and there are no firm criteria. Thus, automated assistance would be useful to clinicians. This study aimed to construct and evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist with such treatment planning. A total of 3,136 orthodontic occlusal photographs with annotations by two orthodontists were obtained. Four convolutional neural network (CNN) models, namely ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19, were adopted for the AI process. Using the intraoral photographs as input, the crowding group and the necessity of tooth extraction were obtained. Arch length discrepancy analysis with AI-detected landmarks was used for crowding categorization. Various statistical and visual analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance. The maxillary and mandibular VGG19 models showed minimum mean errors of 0.84 mm and 1.06 mm for teeth landmark detection, respectively. Analysis of Cohen's weighted kappa coefficient indicated that crowding categorization performance was best in VGG19 (0.73), decreasing in the order of VGG16, ResNet101, and ResNet50. For tooth extraction, the maxillary VGG19 model showed the highest accuracy (0.922) and AUC (0.961). By utilizing deep learning with orthodontic photographs, dental crowding categorization and diagnosis of orthodontic extraction were successfully determined. This suggests that AI can assist clinicians in the diagnosis and decision making of treatment plans.

TI  - Predicting root fracture after root canal treatment and crown installation using deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background/purpose: Vertical root fracture (VRF) is a prevalent reason for tooth extraction following root canal treatment and even after crown placement. Predicting fractures is challenging due to multifactorial nature. The current study aimed to predict the likelihood of fracture following root canal treatment and crown placement by developing a deep learning (DL) model. Materials and methods: DL techniques were employed to analyze a dataset comprising 145 clinical cases consisting of 97 fractured teeth and 48 non-fr actured teeth. This dataset spanned a five-year period and encompassed cases involving root canal therapy and crown installation. The analysis identified several root fracture-related parameters, which were incorporated into the DL system. The dataset consisted of 17 features presented in a mixedtype tabular format. Results: The deep neural network (DNN) model surpassed the support vector machine (SVM) model with a higher accuracy (80.7 % vs. 71.7 %) and F1-score value (0.857 vs. 0.817) for predicting root fracture. Furthermore, in determining root fracture occurrence, it was observed that 17 significant characteristics in the DNN model outperformed the 7 features by 11.7 % in accuracy and 10 % in F1-score. Conclusion: DL shows promise in predicting root fracture post root canal therapy and pros- thesis, and it may have the potential to aid clinicians in assessing fracture risk and improving decision-making. 2023 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

TI  - A Novel Deep Learning-Based Approach for Segmentation of Different Type Caries Lesions on Panoramic Radiographs
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - The study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence system based on deep learning for the segmentation of occlusal, proximal and cervical caries lesions on panoramic radiographs. The study included 504 anonymous panoramic radiographs obtained from the radiology archive of Inonu University Faculty of Dentistry's Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology from January 2018 to January 2020. This study proposes Dental Caries Detection Network (DCDNet) architecture for dental caries segmentation. The main difference between DCDNet and other segmentation architecture is that the last part of DCDNet contains a Multi-Predicted Output (MPO) structure. In MPO, the final feature map split into three different paths for detecting occlusal, proximal and cervical caries. Extensive experimental analyses were executed to analyze the DCDNet network architecture performance. In these comparison results, while the proposed model achieved an average F1-score of 62.79%, the highest average F1-score of 15.69% was achieved with the state-of-the-art segmentation models. These results show that the proposed artificial intelligence-based model can be one of the indispensable auxiliary tools of dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of carious lesions by enabling their detection in different locations with high success.

TI  - Evaluation of AI Model for Cephalometric Landmark Classification (TG Dental)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB  - The accuracy of cephalometric landmark identification for malocclusion classification is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. Identifying these landmarks is often complex and time-consuming for orthodontists. An AI model for classification was recently developed. This model was investigated based on current regulatory considerations as a result of the strict regulations on software systems and the lack of information on artificial intelligence (AI) requirements in this publication. The platform developed by the ITU/WHO for AI is used to assess the models of the application. The auditing procedure assessed the development process concerning medical device regulations, data protection regulations, and ethical considerations. Upon that, the major tasks during the development were evaluated, such as qualification, annotation procedure, and data set attributes. The AI models were investigated under consideration of technical, clinical, regulatory, and ethical considerations. The risk to the patient and user's health can be considered low according to the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) definition. This application facilitates the decision and planning of malocclusion treatment based on lateral cephalograms without cephalometric landmarks. It is comparable with common standards in orthodontic diagnosis.

TI  - Descriptive analysis of dental X-ray images using various practical methods: A review
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB  - In dentistry, practitioners interpret various dental X-ray imaging modalities to identify tooth-related problems, abnormalities, or teeth structure changes. Another aspect of dental imaging is that it can be helpful in the field of biometrics. Human dental image analysis is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the unspecified and uneven structures of various teeth, and hence the manual investigation of dental abnormalities is at par excellence. However, automation in the domain of dental image segmentation and examination is essentially the need of the hour in order to ensure error-free diagnosis and better treatment planning. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of dental image segmentation and analysis by investigating more than 130 research works conducted through various dental imaging modalities, such as various modes of X-ray, CT (Computed Tomography), CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography), etc. Overall state-ofthe-art research works have been classified into three major categories, i.e., image processing, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, and their respective advantages and limitations are identified and discussed. The survey presents extensive details of the state-of-the-art methods, including image modalities, preprocessing applied for image enhancement, performance measures, and datasets utilized.

TI  - Learning Orthodontic Cephalometry through Augmented Reality: <i>A Conceptual Machine Learning Validation Approach</i>
T2  - 2018 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATICS (ICELTICS): INTELLIGENT DEVICES AND COMPUTING FOR ACCELERATING INDUSTRY 4.0 AND ENRICHING SMART SOCIETIES
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICELTICs)
AB  - The orthodontic cephalometry which forms a quintessential radiographic examination provides a valuable diagnostic resource for everyday orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. The method of analyzing the lateral cephalometric radiograph (LCR) has been found to lack effective methods of landmark identification and objective validation. This drawback, with the use of augmented reality (AR) for 3D visualization and machine learning for objective validation, can be effectively incorporated into the learning of cephalometrics. The two technologies together can produce a learning platform by reducing subjective errors and its implications on treatment planning in addition to effectively eliminating dissonance in learning.

TI  - Novel Machine Learning Algorithms for Prediction of Treatment Decisions in Adult Patients With Class III Malocclusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
AB  - Background: Management of Class III (Cl III) dentoskeletal phenotype is often expert-driven.Purpose: The aim is to identify critical morphological features in postcircumpubertal Cl III treatment and appraise the predictive ability of innovative machine learning (ML) algorithms for adult Cl III malocclusion treatment planning.Study design: The Orthodontics Department at the University of Illinois Chicago undertook a retrospective cross-sectional study analyzing Cl III malocclusion cases (2003-2020) through dental records and pretreatment lateral cephalograms.Predictor: Forty features were identified through a literature review and gathered from pretreatment records, serving as ML model inputs. Eight ML models were trained to predict the best treatment for adult Cl III malocclusion.Outcome variable: Predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models, along with the highest-contributing features, were evaluated for performance assessment.Covariates: Demographic covariates, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity, were assessed. Inclusion criteria targeted patients with cervical vertebral maturation stage 4 or above. Operative covariates such as tooth extraction and types of orthognathic surgical maneuvers were also analyzed.Analyses: Demographic characteristics of the camouflage and surgical study groups were described statistically. Shapiro-Wilk Normality test was employed to check data distribution. Differences in means between groups were evaluated using parametric and nonparametric independent sample tests, with statistical significance set at <0.05.Results: The study involved 182 participants; 65 underwent camouflage mechanotherapy, and 117 received orthognathic surgery. No statistical differences were found in demographic characteristics between the two groups (P > .05). Extreme values of pretreatment parameters suggested a surgical approach. Artificial neural network algorithms predicted treatment approach with 91% accuracy, while the Extreme Gradient Boosting model achieved 93% accuracy after recursive feature elimination optimization. The Extreme Gradient Boosting model highlighted Wit's appraisal, anterior overjet, and Mx/Md ratio as key predictors.Conclusions: The research identified significant cephalometric differences between Cl III adults requiring orthodontic camouflage or surgery. A 93% accurate artificial intelligence model was formulated based on these insights, highlighting the potential role of artificial intelligence and ML as adjunct tools in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. This may assist in minimizing clinician subjectivity in borderline cases. (c) 2023 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

TI  - Comparing Artificial Intelligence and Senior Residents in Oral Lesion Diagnosis: A Comparative Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that seeks to build intelligent machines that can carry out tasks that usually necessitate human intelligence. AI may help dentists with a variety of dental tasks, including clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. This study aims to compare the performance of AI and oral medicine residents in diagnosing different cases, providing treatment, and determining if it is reliable to assist them in their field of work. Methods: The study conducted a comparative analysis of the responses from third-and fourth-year residents trained in Oral Medicine and Pathology at King Saud University, College of Dentistry. The residents were given a closed multiple-choice test consisting of 19 questions with four response options labeled A-D and one question with five response options labeled A-E. The test was administered via Google Forms, and each resident's response was stored electronically in an Excel sheet (Microsoft (R) Corp., Redmond, WA). The residents' answers were then compared to the responses generated by three major language models: OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI. The questions were inputted into the language models in the same format as the original test, and prior to each question, an artificial intelligence chat session was created to eliminate memory retention bias. The input was done on November 19, 2023, the same day the official multiple-choice test was administered. The study had a sample size of 20 residents trained in Oral Medicine and Pathology at King Saud University, College of Dentistry, consisting of both third-year and fourth-year residents. Result: The responses of three large language models (LLM), including OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI, as well as the responses of 20 senior residents for 20 clinical cases about oral lesion diagnosis. There were no significant variations observed for the remaining questions in the responses to only two questions (10%). For the remaining questions, there were no significant differences. The median (IQR) score of LLMs was 50.0 (45.0 to 60.0), with a minimum of 40 (for stable diffusion) and a maximum of 70 (for OpenAI). The median (IQR) score of senior residents was 65.0 (55.0-75.0). The highest and lowest scores of residents were 40 and 90, respectively. There was no significant difference in the percent scores of residents and LLMs (p = 0.211). The agreement level was measured using the Kappa value. The agreement among senior dental residents was observed to be weak, with a Kappa value of 0.396. In contrast, the agreement among LLMs demonstrated a moderate level, with a Kappa value of 0.622, suggesting a more cohesive alignment in responses among the artificial intelligence models. When comparing residents' responses with those generated by different OpenAI models, including OpenAI, Stablediffusion, and PopAI, the agreement levels were consistently categorized as weak, with Kappa values of 0.402, 0.381, and 0.392, respectively. Conclusion: What the current study reveals is that when comparing the response score, there is no significant difference, in contrast to the agreement analysis among the residents, which was low compared to the LLMs, in which it was high. Dentists should consider that AI is very beneficial in providing diagnosis and treatment and use it to assist them.

TI  - Merging and Annotating Teeth and Roots from Automated Segmentation of Multimodal Images
T2  - MULTIMODAL LEARNING FOR CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT
CP  - 11th Workshop on Multimodal Learning and Fusion Across Scales for Clinical Decision Support (ML-CDS) held at 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
AB  - This paper aims to combine two different imaging techniques to create an accurate 3D model representation of root canals and dental crowns. We combine Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) (root canals) and Intra Oral Scans (IOS) (dental crowns). The Root Canal Segmentation algorithm relies on a U-Net architecture with 2D sliced images from CBCT scans as its input. The segmentation task achieved an Fl-score of 0.84. The IOS segmentation (Dental Model Segmentation) algorithm and Universal Labeling and Merging (ULM) algorithm use a multi-view approach for 3D shape analysis. The approach consists of acquiring views of the 3D object from different viewpoints and extract surface features such as the normal vectors. The generated 2D images are then analyzed via a 2D convolutional neural networks (U-Net) for segmentation or classification tasks. The segmentation task on IOS achieved an accuracy of 0.9. The ULM algorithm classifies the jaws between upper and lower and aligns them to a template and labels each crown and root with the 'Universal Numbering System' proposed by the 'American Dental Association'. The ULM task achieve an Fl-score of 0.85. Merging and annotation of CBCT and IOS imaging modalities will help guide clinical decision support and quantitative treatment planning for specific teeth, implant placement, root canal treatment, restorative procedures, or biomechanics of tooth movement in orthodontics.

T2  - 2022 IEEE 19TH INDIA COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, INDICON
CP  - 19th IEEE-India-Council International Conference (INDICON)
AB  - With a wide range of applications in cosmetic dentistry treatments, and treatment planning, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is having a growing influence in the field of dentistry and is enhancing the growth of digital tools and technology. The surgical sector, automatic disease diagnosis, and recently established customized medicine are just a few of the disciplines that might benefit from AI support. Personalized medicine provides the inclination to diseases, diagnosis, and selection of the best treatment for a specific individual. In fields like image processing, deep learning has been able to match and improve human performance for exceedingly complicated tasks such as object detection models with classification, and prediction capabilities and for the identification of numerous dental diseases and their differential treatments. Many of these neural network applications face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled medical datasets, and oral disease datasets are no exception. This pilot study makes it possible to identify various dental diseases and the treatments for them by utilizing a dataset of 664 dental panoramic X-ray images which is considered a small number. These images have been used for training after being manually labeled for 9 separate classes. You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5, a one-step search method primarily utilized for real-time object detection, is the deep neural network that was used in this study. Bounding boxes helped identify six differential treatments and three classes of dental diseases. Results show that this strategy was able to attain a Precision of 1.00, F1 score of 0.74, Recall of 0.83, and mAP of 72.4 percent by training with this smaller number of images, which shows tremendous potential for dentists and radiologists.

TI  - Determinants of Clinical Decision Making under Uncertainty in Dentistry: A Scoping Review
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at systematically evaluating dental practitioners' clinical decision-making processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes.

TI  - An Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Analyze Patient Information to Improve Oral Health Outcomes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: Various health-related fields have applied Machine learning (ML) techniques such as textmining, topicmodeling (TM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) to automate tasks otherwise completed by humans to enhance patient care. However, research in dentistry on the integration of these techniques into the clinic arena has yet to exist. Thus, the purpose of this study was to: introduce a method of automating the reviewing patient chart information using ML, provide a step-by-step description of how it was conducted, and demonstrate this method's potential to identify predictive relationships between patient chart information and important oral health-related contributors.
   Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted to demonstrate the approach on a set of anonymized patient charts collected from a dental clinic. Two ML applications for patient chart review were demonstrated: (1) text mining and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were used to preprocess, model, and cluster data in a narrative format and extract common topics for further analysis, (2) Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) and ANN were used to determine predictive relationships between the extracted patient chart data topics and oral health-related contributors. All analysis was conducted in R and SPSS (IBM, SPSS, statistics 22).
   Results: Data from 785 patient charts were analyzed. Preprocessing of raw data (data cleaning and categorizing) identified 66 variables, of which 45 were included for analysis. Using LDA, 10 radiographic findings topics and 8 treatment planning topics were extracted from the data. OLR showed that caries risk, occlusal risk, biomechanical risk, gingival recession, periodontitis, gingivitis, assisted mouth opening, and muscle tenderness were highly predictable using the extracted radiographic and treatment planning topics and chart information. Using the statistically significant predictors obtained from OLR, ANN analysis showed that the model can correctly predict >72% of all variables except for bruxism and tooth crowding (63.1 and 68.9%, respectively).
   Conclusion: Our study presents a novel approach to address the need for data-enabled innovations in the field of dentistry and creates new areas of research in dental analytics. Utilizing ML methods and its application in dental practice has the potential to improve clinicians' and patients' understanding of the major factors that contribute to oral health diseases/conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of the Progression of Periodontitis with the Use of Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the tissues surrounding the tooth that results in loss of periodontal attachment detected as clinical attachment loss (CAL). The mildest form of periodontal disease is gingivitis, which is a necessary condition for periodontitis development. We can distinguish also some modifying factors which have an influence on the rate of development of periodontitis from which the most important are smoking and poorly controlled diabetes. According to the new classification from 2017, we can identify four stages of periodontitis and three grades of periodontitis. Grades tell us about the periodontitis progression risk and may be helpful in treatment planning and motivating the patients. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used in medicine and in dentistry as an additional tool to support clinicians in their work. In this paper, ANN was used to assess grades of periodontitis in the group of patients. Gender, age, nicotinism approximal plaque index (API), bleeding on probing (BoP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and pocket depth (PD) were taken into consideration. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical periodontal assessment in relation to the neural network assessment. Based on the definition of the sensitivity and specificity in medicine we obtained 85.7% and 80.0% as a correctly diagnosed and excluded disease, respectively. The quality of the neural network, defined as the percentage of correctly classified patients according to the grade of periodontitis was 84.2% for the training set. The percentage of incorrectly classified patients according to the grade of periodontitis was 15.8%. Artificial neural networks may be useful tool in everyday dental practice to assess the risk of periodontitis development however more studies are needed.

TI  - Deep learning method for reducing metal artifacts in dental cone-beam CT using supplementary information from intra-oral scan
T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB  - Objective. Recently, dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) methods have been improved to significantly reduce radiation dose while maintaining image resolution with minimal equipment cost. In low-dose CBCT environments, metallic inserts such as implants, crowns, and dental fillings cause severe artifacts, which result in a significant loss of morphological structures of teeth in reconstructed images. Such metal artifacts prevent accurate 3D bone-teeth-jaw modeling for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the performance of existing metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods in handling the loss of the morphological structures of teeth in reconstructed CT images remains relatively limited. In this study, we developed an innovative MAR method to achieve optimal restoration of anatomical details. Approach. The proposed MAR approach is based on a two-stage deep learning-based method. In the first stage, we employ a deep learning network that utilizes intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and performs multi-task learning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. The network is designed to improve the learning ability of capturing teeth-related features effectively while mitigating metal artifacts. In the second stage, a 3D bone-teeth-jaw model is constructed with weighted thresholding, where the weighting region is determined depending on the geometry of the intra-oral scan data. Main results. The results of numerical simulations and clinical experiments are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Significance. We propose for the first time a MAR method using radiation-free intra-oral scan data as supplemental information on the tooth morphological structures of teeth, which is designed to perform accurate 3D bone-teeth-jaw modeling in low-dose CBCT environments.

TI  - Influence of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Diagnostic Tools on Treatment Decision-Making in Early Childhood Caries: A Systematic Review of Accuracy and Clinical Outcomes
T2  - DENTISTRY JOURNAL
AB  - Early detection and accurate prediction of the risk of early childhood caries (ECC) are essential for effective prevention and management. This systematic review aims to assess the performance and applicability of machine learning algorithms in ECC prediction and detection. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify studies utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict or detect ECC. The included (n = 6) studies demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values related to predicting and detecting ECC. The application of machine learning algorithms contributed to enhanced clinical decision-making, targeted preventive measures, and improved ECC management. The studies also highlighted the importance of considering multiple factors, including demographic, environmental, and genetic factors, when developing dental caries prediction models. Machine learning algorithms hold significant potential for ECC prediction and detection, having promising performance outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, no meta-analysis could be performed. Moreover, further research is needed to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of integrating these algorithms into dental practice. This approach would ultimately contribute to enabling more effective and personalized dental caries management and improved oral health outcomes for diverse populations.

TI  - Comparison of AudaxCeph?'s fully automated cephalometric tracing technology to a semi-automated approach by human examiners
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Objective > To compare the reliability of cephalometric landmark identification by an automated tracing software based on convolutional neural networks to human tracers.Materials and methods > Sixty cephalograms were traced by two board-certified orthodontists and AudaxCeph (R)'s artificial intelligence software. The following thirteen landmarks were identified in each tracing: Sella, Nasion, A point, B point, Porion, Menton, Pogonion, Orbitale, Gonion, Upper Central Incisor Incisal Edge (U1 Tip), Upper Central Incisor Root Apex (U1 apex), Lower Central Incisor Incisal Edge (L1 Tip), Lower Central Incisor Root Apex (L1 apex). An x-y axis was positioned in the bottom left corner of each cephalogram, and the x- and y-coordinates for the landmarks were exported into Excel. Distributions of landmarks (X, Y, radial distance) were compared using t -tests of equivalence with a 2 mm equivalence bound. These compared the AI position to the two orthodontists - and the orthodontists' reliability by comparing equivalence against each other.Results > There was no statistical difference between the orthodontists and AudaxCeph (R)'s auto-matic tracing software except for the x- and y-dimension of Porion and the y-dimension of L1 apex. The two orthodontists had good intra-examiner reliability with no statistical difference found when comparing them.Conclusion > AudaxCeph (R)'s automated cephalometric tracing software is a good adjunctive tool to use when diagnosing and treatment planning orthodontic cases.

AB  - Stored red blood cells (RBCs) are needed for life-saving blood transfusions, but they undergo continuous degradation. RBC storage lesions are often assessed by microscopic examination or biochemical and biophysical assays, which are complex, time-consuming, and destructive to fragile cells. Here we demonstrate the use of label-free imaging flow cytometry and deep learning to characterize RBC lesions. Using brightfield images, a trained neural network achieved 76.7% agreement with experts in classifying seven clinically relevant RBC morphologies associated with storage lesions, comparable to 82.5% agreement between different experts. Given that human observation and classification may not optimally discern RBC quality, we went further and eliminated subjective human annotation in the training step by training a weakly supervised neural network using only storage duration times. The feature space extracted by this network revealed a chronological progression of morphological changes that better predicted blood quality, as measured by physiological hemolytic assay readouts, than the conventional expert-assessed morphology classification system. With further training and clinical testing across multiple sites, protocols, and instruments, deep learning and label-free imaging flow cytometry might be used to routinely and objectively assess RBC storage lesions. This would automate a complex protocol, minimize laboratory sample handling and preparation, and reduce the impact of procedural errors and discrepancies between facilities and blood donors. The chronology-based machine-learning approach may also improve upon humans' assessment of morphological changes in other biomedically important progressions, such as differentiation and metastasis.

TI  - Deep learning convolutional neural network algorithms for the early detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs: A systematic review
T2  - IMAGING SCIENCE IN DENTISTRY
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyse and review deep learning convolutional neural networks for detecting and diagnosing early-stage dental caries on periapical radiographs.
   Materials and Methods: In order to conduct this review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies published from 2015 to 2021 under the keywords (deep convolutional neural network) AND (caries), (deep learning caries) AND (convolutional neural network) AND (caries) were systematically reviewed.
   Results: When dental caries is improperly diagnosed, the lesion may eventually invade the enamel, dentin, and pulp tissue, leading to loss of tooth function. Rapid and precise detection and diagnosis are vital for implementing appropriate prevention and treatment of dental caries. Radiography and intraoral images are considered to play a vital role in detecting dental caries; nevertheless, studies have shown that 20% of suspicious areas are mistakenly diagnosed as dental caries using this technique; hence, diagnosis via radiography alone without an objective assessment is inaccurate. Identifying caries with a deep convolutional neural network-based detector enables the operator to distinguish changes in the location and morphological features of dental caries lesions. Deep learning algorithms have broader and more profound layers and are continually being developed, remarkably enhancing their precision in detecting and segmenting objects.
   Conclusion: Clinical applications of deep learning convolutional neural networks in the dental field have shown significant accuracy in detecting and diagnosing dental caries, and these models hold promise in supporting dental practitioners to improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Crown therapy in young individuals with amelogenesis imperfecta: Long term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization. Several problems are associated with AI: hypersensitivity, wear, restorations requiring replacement, gingivitis, aesthetic problems, and social avoidance. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of crown therapy in young individuals with AI showing excellent results. This study reports results from a long-term-follow-up with focus on quality, longevity and adverse events.
   Methods: The RCT included 27 patients (aged 11-22 years) with severe AI in need of crown therapy and used a split-mouth technique. After placing 119 Procera (R) crowns and 108 IPS e.max Press crowns following randomization, we assessed longevity, quality, adverse events, and tooth sensitivity and calculated survival rates and success rates.
   Results: We followed the original 227 crowns for 4.3-7.4 years (mean 5.5 +/- 0.8). In all, 79% (193) crowns were followed for at least 5 years. The survival rate was 99.6% and the success rate, 94.7%; 95% of the crowns had excellent or acceptable quality. Due to suboptimal marginal integrity, 4% of the crowns required adjustment. Sensitivity problems decreased after crown therapy (p < 0.001). All adverse events occurred in patients aged 19-23 years and involved apical periodontitis (3% of teeth); all but two events were related to dental trauma in the actual tooth.
   Conclusions: Ceramic crown therapy in adolescents and young adults with severe forms of AI show excellent survival and success rates and longevity with few adverse events.
   Clinical significance: Ceramic crown therapy can be recommended for adolescents and young adults with severe forms of amelogenesis imperfecta.

TI  - Preoperative risk assessment does not allow to predict root filling length using machine learning: A longitudinal study
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: First we aimed to identify significant associations between preoperative risk factors and achieving optimal root filling length (RFL) during orthograde root canal treatments (RCT) and second to predict successful RFL using machine learning. Methods: Teeth receiving RCT at one university clinic from 2016-2020 with complete documentation were included. Successful RFL was defined to be 0-2mm of the apex, suboptimal RFL >2mm or beyond the apex. Logistic regression (logR) was used for association analyses; logR and more advanced machine learning (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)) were employed for predictive modeling. Results: 555 completed RCT (343 patients, female/male 32.1/67.9%) were included. In our association analysis (involving the full dataset), unsuccessful RFL was more likely in undergraduate students (US): OR 2.74, 95% CI [1.61, 4.75], p < 0.001), teeth with indistinct canal paths (OR 11.04, [2.87, 44.88], p < 0.001), root canals reduced in size (OR 2.56, [1.49, 4.46], p < 0.01), retreatments (OR 3.13, [1.6, 6.41], p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that dentists were more successful in mitigating risks than undergraduate students. Prediction of RFL on a separate testset was limitedly possible regardless of the machine learning approach. Conclusions: Achieving RFL is depending on the operator and several risk factors. The predictive performance on the technical outcome of a root canal treatment utilizing ML algorithms was insufficient. Clinical significance: Preoperative risk assessment is a relevant step in endodontic treatment planning. Single radiographic risk factors were significantly associated with achieving (or not achieving) optimal RFL and showed higher predictive value than a more complex risk assessment form.

T2  - BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL
AB  - Aim The present study aimed to explore the perceptions of dental students regarding the ethical considerations associated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in clinical decision-making.Methods All the undergraduate clinical-year dental students were invited to take part in the study. A validated online questionnaire which consisted of 21 closed-ended questions (five-point Likert scales) was distributed to the students to evaluate their perceptions on the topic. Mean perception scores of the students from different years were analysed using a one-way ANOVA test, while independent t-tests were used to compare the scores between sexes.Results In total, 165 students participated in the present study. The mean age of the respondents was 23.3 (+/- 1.38) years and the majority were female, Chinese students. Respondents showed positive perceptions throughout all three domains. Uniform and comparable perceptions were seen across various academic years and sexes, with female respondents expressing stronger agreement regarding patient consent and privacy prioritisation.Conclusion Undergraduate clinical dental students generally showed positive perceptions regarding the ethical considerations associated with the integration of AI algorithms in clinical decision-making. It is essential to address these ethical considerations to ensure that AI benefits patient outcomes while upholding fundamental ethical principles and patient-centred care.
   The findings highlighted that dental students generally have positive perceptions regarding the ethical considerations of using AI algorithms in clinical decision-making.Female respondents showed stronger agreement regarding patient consent and privacy prioritisation, while slightly higher overall scores were noted among final-year dental students.The study suggested the need for dental educators to integrate lessons about patient rights and ethics into the curriculum to ensure future practitioners are well-prepared for responsible and ethical AI integration in dentistry.

TI  - Teeth Segmentation in Panoramic Dental X-ray Using Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are capable of learning complex patterns and features from images. An automatic teeth segmentation CNN model can accurately and efficiently identify the boundaries and contours of individual teeth in dental radiographs or 3D dental scans. This can save significant time and effort compared to manual segmentation by dental professionals. Precise segmentation of teeth can assist in the diagnosis and treatment planning process. By accurately identifying the boundaries of teeth, dental practitioners can more effectively analyze dental conditions, such as tooth decay, gum diseases, or orthodontic abnormalities. This enables them to make informed decisions regarding appropriate treatment options and personalized treatment plans. Background and purpose: Accurate instance segmentation of teeth in panoramic dental X-rays is a challenging task due to variations in tooth morphology and overlapping regions. In this study, we propose a new algorithm, for instance, segmentation of the different teeth in panoramic dental X-rays. Methods: An instance segmentation model was trained using the architecture of a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN). The data for the training, validation, and testing were taken from the Tuft dental database (1000 panoramic dental radiographs). The number of the predicted label was 52 (20 deciduous and 32 permanent). The size of the training, validation, and test sets were 760, 190, and 70 images, respectively, and the split was performed randomly. The model was trained for 300 epochs, using a batch size of 10, a base learning rate of 0.001, and a warm-up multistep learning rate scheduler (gamma = 0.1). Data augmentation was performed by changing the brightness, contrast, crop, and image size. The percentage of correctly detected teeth and Dice in the test set were used as the quality metrics for the model. Results: In the test set, the percentage of correctly classified teeth was 98.4%, while the Dice score was 0.87. For both the left mandibular central and lateral incisor permanent teeth, the Dice index result was 0.91 and the accuracy was 100%. For the permanent teeth right mandibular first molar, mandibular second molar, and third molar, the Dice indexes were 0.92, 0.93, and 0.78, respectively, with an accuracy of 100% for all three different teeth. For deciduous teeth, the Dice indexes for the right mandibular lateral incisor, right mandibular canine, and right mandibular first molar were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.85, respectively, with an accuracy of 100%. Conclusions: A successful instance segmentation model for teeth identification in panoramic dental X-ray was developed and validated. This model may help speed up and automate tasks like teeth counting and identifying specific missing teeth, improving the current clinical practice.

TI  - Full virtual patient generated by artificial intelligence-driven integrated segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures from CBCT images
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: To assess the performance, time-efficiency, and consistency of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based automated approach for integrated segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures compared with semiautomated method for creating a virtual patient using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Methods: Thirty CBCT scans were selected. Six craniomaxillofacial structures, encompassing the maxillofacial complex bones, maxillary sinus, dentition, mandible, mandibular canal, and pharyngeal airway space, were segmented on these scans using semi-automated and composite of previously validated CNN-based automated segmentation techniques for individual structures. A qualitative assessment of the automated segmentation revealed the need for minor refinements, which were manually corrected. These refined segmentations served as a reference for comparing semi-automated and automated integrated segmentations. Results: The majority of minor adjustments with the automated approach involved under-segmentation of sinus mucosal thickening and regions with reduced bone thickness within the maxillofacial complex. The automated and the semi-automated approaches required an average time of 1.1 min and 48.4 min, respectively. The automated method demonstrated a greater degree of similarity (99.6 %) to the reference than the semiautomated approach (88.3 %). The standard deviation values for all metrics with the automated approach were low, indicating a high consistency. Conclusions: The CNN-driven integrated segmentation approach proved to be accurate, time-efficient, and consistent for creating a CBCT-derived virtual patient through simultaneous segmentation of craniomaxillofacial structures. Clinical relevance: The creation of a virtual orofacial patient using an automated approach could potentially transform personalized digital workflows. This advancement could be particularly beneficial for treatment planning in a variety of dental and maxillofacial specialties.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation of Mandible from Conventional Methods to Deep Learning-A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB  - Medical imaging techniques, such as (cone beam) computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have proven to be a valuable component for oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS). Accurate segmentation of the mandible from head and neck (H&N) scans is an important step in order to build a personalized 3D digital mandible model for 3D printing and treatment planning of OMFS. Segmented mandible structures are used to effectively visualize the mandible volumes and to evaluate particular mandible properties quantitatively. However, mandible segmentation is always challenging for both clinicians and researchers, due to complex structures and higher attenuation materials, such as teeth (filling) or metal implants that easily lead to high noise and strong artifacts during scanning. Moreover, the size and shape of the mandible vary to a large extent between individuals. Therefore, mandible segmentation is a tedious and time-consuming task and requires adequate training to be performed properly. With the advancement of computer vision approaches, researchers have developed several algorithms to automatically segment the mandible during the last two decades. The objective of this review was to present the available fully (semi)automatic segmentation methods of the mandible published in different scientific articles. This review provides a vivid description of the scientific advancements to clinicians and researchers in this field to help develop novel automatic methods for clinical applications.

TI  - Deep learning improves prediction of periodontal therapy effectiveness in Chinese patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERIODONTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The objective: This study aims to propose a new model to predict the specific treatment effectiveness at site level by analyzing massive amounts of periodontal clinical data with deep learning methods.
   The background data discussing the present status of the field: In light of the low accuracy of current tools, the proposed models cannot fully meet the needs of clinical effectiveness prediction and cannot be applied to on site level prognosis development and formulation of specific treatment plan.
   Materials and Methods: Periodontal examination data of 9273 Chinese patients were extracted and used to propose a Sequence-to-Sequence model after performing data management and reconstruction. The model was optimized by introducing the Attention mechanism.
   Results: In the test set, the model obtained an average site-level probing depth (PD) accuracy (defined as the proportion of sites with <1 mm deviation of the predicted result from the true value) of 92.4% and high sensitivity (98.6%) for the pocket closure variable. For sites with baseline PD <5 mm, the model achieved a prediction accuracy of 94.6%, while it decreased to 79.9% at sites with PD >= 5 mm. In contrast, for teeth with initial mean PD >= 5 mm, the prediction accuracy significantly differed between molars and non-molars.
   Conclusion: Our model is the first to predict the site-level effectiveness with high accuracy and sensitivity. Future prediction models should incorporate deep learning for improved clinical prediction.

TI  - Improving resolution of panoramic radiographs: super-resolution concept
T2  - DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives Dental imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of dental conditions, yet limitations regarding the quality and resolution of dental radiographs sometimes hinder precise analysis. Super-resolution with deep learning refers to a set of techniques used to enhance the resolution of images beyond their original size or quality using deep neural networks instead of traditional image interpolation methods which often result in blurred or pixelated images when attempting to increase resolution. Leveraging advancements in technology, this study aims to enhance the resolution of dental panoramic radiographs, thereby enabling more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.Methods About 1714 panoramic radiographs from 3 different open datasets are used for training (n = 1364) and testing (n = 350). The state of the art 4 different models is explored, namely Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network, Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, and Autoencoder. Performances in reconstructing high-resolution dental images from low-resolution inputs with different scales (s = 2, 4, 8) are evaluated by 2 well-accepted metrics Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).Results SSIM spans between 0.82 and 0.98 while PSNR are between 28.7 and 40.2 among all scales and models. SRCNN provides the best performance. Additionally, it is observed that performance decreased when images are scaled with higher values.Conclusion The findings highlight the potential of super-resolution concepts to significantly improve the quality and detail of dental panoramic radiographs, thereby contributing to enhanced interpretability.

TI  - Coarse-to-fine prior-guided attention network for multi-structure segmentation on dental panoramic radiographs
T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB  - Objective. Accurate segmentation of various anatomical structures from dental panoramic radiographs is essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of various diseases in digital dentistry. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for accurate and fully automatic segmentation of the maxillary sinus, mandibular condyle, mandibular nerve, alveolar bone and teeth on panoramic radiographs. Approach. A two-stage coarse-to-fine prior-guided segmentation framework is proposed to segment multiple structures on dental panoramic radiographs. In the coarse stage, a multi-label segmentation network is used to generate the coarse segmentation mask, and in the fine-tuning stage, a prior-guided attention network with an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to precisely predict the mask of each anatomical structure. First, a prior-guided edge fusion module is incorporated into the network at the input of each convolution level of the encode path to generate edge-enhanced image feature maps. Second, a prior-guided spatial attention module is proposed to guide the network to extract relevant spatial features from foreground regions based on the combination of the prior information and the spatial attention mechanism. Finally, a prior-guided hybrid attention module is integrated at the bottleneck of the network to explore global context from both spatial and category perspectives. Main results. We evaluated the segmentation performance of our method on a testing dataset that contains 150 panoramic radiographs collected from real-world clinical scenarios. The segmentation results indicate that our proposed method achieves more accurate segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. The average Jaccard scores are 87.91%, 85.25%, 63.94%, 93.46% and 88.96% for the maxillary sinus, mandibular condyle, mandibular nerve, alveolar bone and teeth, respectively. Significance. The proposed method was able to accurately segment multiple structures on panoramic radiographs. This method has the potential to be part of the process of automatic pathology diagnosis from dental panoramic radiographs.

TI  - Revolutionising Precision and Efficiency of Dental Implant Placement through Digital Planning Software: A Narrative Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
AB  - Advancements have transformed dentistry, and digital planning software has emerged as a revolutionary tool in implantology. The present review explores the capabilities, benefits, and limitations of digital planning software in implantology, emphasising its impact on clinical practice and patient outcomes. Traditional implant planning relied on Two-dimensional (2D) radiographs and physical study models, limiting accuracy and predictability. Digital planning software utilises advanced imaging technologies to generate precise Threedimensional (3D) models of the patient's dentition, enabling comprehensive treatment planning. Key features include 3D visualisation, virtual implant placement, prosthetic-driven planning, and simulations. These features enhance accuracy, enable collaborative decisionmaking, and streamline the treatment process. Commercially available digital planning software options offer similar advantages but also have unique features. Studies support the clinical efficacy of digital planning in implant placement, showing improved accuracy, patient satisfaction, and reduced complications. However, more randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of digitally guided implant placement. Considerations include the need for high-quality input data, a learning curve for software proficiency, and cost considerations. Nevertheless, digital planning software has become an indispensable tool in implantology, enhancing treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction. The future of digital planning software in implantology lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration, automation, and personalised recommendations. With ongoing advancements, digital planning software will continue to revolutionise implantology, optimising treatment planning and execution for improved patient care.

TI  - Clinical use of digital applications for diagnostic and treatment planning in prosthodontics: A scoping review
T2  - CLINICAL ORAL IMPLANTS RESEARCH
AB  - AimThis scoping review aimed to compile and evaluate clinical trials investigating digital applications in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning by assessing their clinical relevance and future potential.MethodsFollowing the PCC-framework for scoping reviews and combining the source of analysis (Population/P: "prosthodontics"), the technique of interest (Concept/C: "digital application") and the field of interest (Context/C: "diagnostics"), a three-pronged search strategy was applied in the database PubMed and Web of Science. Clinical trials (>= 10 study participants, English/German) were considered until 2023-03-09. Reporting adhered to the PRISMA-ScR statement.ResultsThe search identified 520 titles, of which 18 full-texts met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. The trials involved a total of 14,457 study participants and were mapped for prosthetic subdisciplines: fixed (n = 9; 50%) and removable (n = 4; 22%) prosthodontics, reconstructive dentistry in general (n = 3; 17%), and temporo-mandibular joint disorders (n = 2; 11%). Data merging of medical format files, as DICOM+STL, was the dominant digital application (n = 7; 39%); and virtual treatment simulation using digital smile design or digital wax-up represented the most frequent prosthetic diagnostics (n = 6; 33%).ConclusionThis scoping review identified a relatively low number of clinical trials. The future potential of digital diagnostics appears to be mostly related to the subdiscipline of fixed prosthodontics, especially regarding virtual treatment simulation for communication with the patient and among dental professionals. Artificial intelligence emerged as a key technology in many of the identified studies. Further research in this area is needed to explore the capabilities of digital technologies in prosthetic diagnostics and treatment planning.

TI  - Deep learning for the identification of ridge deficiency around dental implants
T2  - CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the automatic identification of the ridge deficiency around dental implants based on an image slice from cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT).Materials and methods: Single slices crossing the central long-axis of 630 mandibular and 845 maxillary virtually placed implants (4-5 mm diameter, 10 mm length) in 412 patients were used. The ridges were classified based on the intraoral bone-implant support and sinus floor location. The slices were either preprocessed by alveolar ridge homogenizing prior to DL (preprocessed) or left unpreprocessed. A convolutional neural network with ResNet-50 architecture was employed for DL.Results: The model achieved an accuracy of >98.5% on the unpreprocessed image slices and was found to be superior to the accuracy observed on the preprocessed slices. On the mandible, model accuracy was 98.91 +/- 1.45%, and F1 score, a measure of a model's accuracy in binary classification tasks, was lowest (97.30%) on the ridge with a combined horizontal-vertical defect. On the maxilla, model accuracy was 98.82 +/- 1.11%, and the ridge presenting an implant collar-sinus floor distance of 5-10 mm with a dehiscence defect had the lowest F1 score (95.86%). To achieve >90% model accuracy, >= 441 mandibular slices or >= 592 maxillary slices were required.Conclusions: The ridge deficiency around dental implants can be identified using DL from CBCT image slices without the need for preprocessed homogenization. The model will be further strengthened by implementing more clinical expertise in dental implant treatment planning and incorporating multiple slices to classify 3-dimensional implant-ridge relationships.

TI  - THE DIGITAL PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT AND EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION FOR COMPLEX DENTAL TREATMENT
T2  - NEW ARMENIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The work is devoted to the development of a protocol for digital planning of dental treatment with the use of high-precision instruments and confirmation of its clinical effectiveness.
   A detailed analysis of the diagnostic and planning resources of dental treatment was carried out at the first stage of this study to optimize and structure them into a single digital complex. The analysis of cone-beam computed tomography results was provided with the artificial intelligence technology called Diagnocat. We compared the automated software report with the description of the radiographic scans of the same patients for the validation of artificial intelligence compiled by dental experts, who have continuous record of service in the specialty for more than 10 years in the specialization.
   To confirm the clinical effectiveness of the developed digital dental planning, 109 patients were examined who demanded aesthetic porcelain restorations in the maxillary arch. The study included 48 patients, randomly divided into a study group and a control group of 24 patients. At the end of the prototype, all patients were surveyed to assess the quality of life and satisfied dental treatment using OHIP-14 (Oral Health Impact Profile) questionnaire.
   In total, according to the results of the report analysis compiled by an expert group and a software based on artificial intelligence, 439 pathologies were identified in 638 teeth. The obtained results of the CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) analysis give grounds to draw conclusions about the obvious superiority of artificial intelligence technology in terms of the time spent on diagnostics and the quality of dental patient radiological description. Summarizing the results of the questionnaire survey based on the OHIP-14 questionnaire, we can conclude that the quality of life of patients has doubled according to the results of the digital dental treatment planning complex.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural network-based automated segmentation and classification of teeth with orthodontic brackets on cone-beam computed-tomographic images: a validation study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Objective Tooth segmentation and classification from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a prerequisite for diagnosis and treatment planning in the majority of digital dental workflows. However, an accurate and efficient segmentation of teeth in the presence of metal artefacts still remains a challenge. Therefore, the following study aimed to validate an automated deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based tool for the segmentation and classification of teeth with orthodontic brackets on CBCT images.
   Methods A total of 215 CBCT scans (1780 teeth) were retrospectively collected, consisting of pre- and post-operative images of the patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment. All the scans were acquired with NewTom CBCT device. A complete dentition with orthodontic brackets and high-quality images were included. The dataset were randomly divided into three subsets with random allocation of all 32 tooth classes: training set (140 CBCT scans-400 teeth), validation set (35 CBCT scans-100 teeth), and test set (pre-operative: 25, post-operative: 15 = 40 CBCT scans-1280 teeth). A multiclass CNN-based tool was developed and its performance was assessed for automated segmentation and classification of teeth with brackets by comparison with a ground truth.
   Results The CNN model took 13.7 +/- 1.2 s for the segmentation and classification of all the teeth on a single CBCT image. Overall, the segmentation performance was excellent with a high intersection over union (IoU) of 0.99. Anterior teeth showed a significantly lower IoU (P < 0.05) compared to premolar and molar teeth. The dice similarity coefficient score of anterior (0.99 +/- 0.02) and premolar teeth (0.99 +/- 0.10) in the pre-operative group was comparable to the post-operative group. The classification of teeth to the correct 32 classes had a high recall rate (99.9%) and precision (99%).
   Conclusions The proposed CNN model outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. It could act as a viable alternative for automatic segmentation and classification of teeth with brackets.
   Clinical Significance The proposed method could simplify the existing digital workflows of orthodontics, orthognathic surgery, restorative dentistry, and dental implantology by offering an accurate and efficient automated segmentation approach to clinicians, hence further enhancing the treatment predictability and outcomes.

TI  - Automatic Classification System for Periapical Lesions in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Imaging examinations are of remarkable importance for diagnostic support in Dentistry. Imaging techniques allow analysis of dental and maxillofacial tissues (e.g., bone, dentine, and enamel) that are inaccessible through clinical examination, which aids in the diagnosis of diseases as well as treatment planning. The analysis of imaging exams is not trivial; so, it is usually performed by oral and maxillofacial radiologists. The increasing demand for imaging examinations motivates the development of an automatic classification system for diagnostic support, as proposed in this paper, in which we aim to classify teeth as healthy or with endodontic lesion. The classification system was developed based on a Siamese Network combined with the use of convolutional neural networks with transfer learning for VGG-16 and DenseNet-121 networks. For this purpose, a database with 1000 sagittal and coronal sections of cone-beam CT scans was used. The results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, and F1-score show that the proposed system has a satisfactory classification performance. The innovative automatic classification system led to an accuracy of about 70%. The work is pioneer since, to the authors knowledge, no other previous work has used a Siamese Network for the purpose of classifying teeth as healthy or with endodontic lesion, based on cone-beam computed tomography images.

TI  - Accuracy of Digital Orthodontic Treatment Planning: Assessing Aligner-Directed Tooth Movements and Exploring Inherent Intramaxillary Side Effects
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The attainment of precise posterior occlusion alignment necessitates a deeper understanding of the clinical efficacy of aligner therapy. This study aims to determine whether the treatment goals defined in the virtual planning of aligner therapy are effectively implemented in clinical practice, with a particular focus on the influence of distalization distances on potential vertical side effects. Methods: In this retrospective, non-interventional investigation, a cohort of 20 individuals undergoing Invisalign (R) treatment was examined. Pre- and post-treatment maxillary clinical and ClinCheck (R) casts were superimposed utilizing a surface-surface matching algorithm on palatal folds, median palatine raphe, and unmoved teeth as the stable references. The effectivity of planned versus clinical movements was evaluated. Groupings were based on distalization distances, planned vertical movements, and Class II elastic prescription. Statistics were performed with a two-sample t-test and p-value < 0.05. Results: Clinically achieved distalization was significantly lower than virtually planned distalization, regardless of additional vertical movements, where a lack of implementation was contingent upon the extent of distalization, with no mitigating effects observed with the application of Class II elastics. Intriguingly, no adverse vertical side effects were noted; however, the intended intrusions or extrusions, as per the therapeutic plans, remained unattainable regardless of the magnitude of distalization. Conclusions: These findings underscore the imperative for future investigations to delve deeper into the intricacies surrounding translational mesio-distal and vertical movements, thereby enhancing predictability within orthodontic practice. To facilitate successful clinical implementation of vertical and translational movements via aligners, the incorporation of sliders emerges as a promising strategy for bolstering anchorage reinforcement.

TI  - Orthognathic surgery past, present, and future
T2  - CLINICAL AND INVESTIGATIVE ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Orthognathic surgery has been performed for over two centuries with the first procedure occurring in the 1860s. It was not until the late 1950s with the pioneering work of Obwegeser that the modern orthognathic surgery era began. From the beginning, oral surgeons and orthodontists have worked in parallel fashion; advances in both disciplines have led to what is now routinely performed. New and exciting developments are underway not only in diagnosis but also in treatment planning with computer aided surgical simulation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance patient treatment outcomes. The purpose of this article is to briefly review the history of orthognathic surgery, to examine the present status and to highlight emerging technologies and advancements.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of Crown Therapy in Young Individuals with Amelogenesis Imperfecta
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization. Existing treatment recommendations suggest resin-composite restorations until adulthood, although such restorations have a limited longevity. New crown materials allow for minimal preparation techniques. The aim of this study was to compare the quality and longevity of 2 crown types-Procera and IPS e.max Press-in adolescents and young adults with AI. A secondary aim was to document adverse events. We included 27 patients (11 to 22 y of age) with AI in need of crown therapy in a randomized controlled trial using a split-mouth technique. After placing 119 Procera crowns and 108 IPS e.max Press crowns following randomization, we recorded longevity, quality, adverse events, and tooth sensitivity. After 2 y, 97% of the crowns in both crown groups had excellent or acceptable quality. We found no significant differences in quality between Procera and IPS e.max Press crowns. Tooth sensitivity was significantly reduced after crown therapy (P < 0.001). Endodontic complications occurred in 3% of crowns. The results show that it is possible to perform crown therapy with excellent results and without severe complications in young patients with AI. The study is registered at http://www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN70438627).

AB  - This paper presents a model-based vision system using finite element analysis (FEA) for dentistry that will assist in diagnosis, treatment planning and surgical simulation. Dentistry requires the accurate 3-D representation of the teeth and jaws for diagnostic and treatment purposes. The proposed integrated computer vision system reconstructs a 3-D model of the patient's dental occlusion using an intra-oral video camera and modified shape from shading (SFS) technique. Data fusion and 3-D registration techniques develop the complete jaw model. Triangulation is then performed, and a digital 3-D model is obtained. Tooth separation and segmentation is then performed to identify and categorize each tooth in the model. Predefined finite element 3D teeth models are then deformed to match the actual reconstructed teeth. These models are used in simulating tooth movements when subjected to a certain treatment process.

TI  - Deep Multi-Scale Mesh Feature Learning for Automated Labeling of Raw Dental Surfaces From 3D Intraoral Scanners
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB  - Precisely labeling teeth on digitalized 3D dental surface models is the precondition for tooth position rearrangements in orthodontic treatment planning. However, it is a challenging task primarily due to the abnormal and varying appearance of patients' teeth. The emerging utilization of intraoral scanners (IOSs) in clinics further increases the difficulty in automated tooth labeling, as the raw surfaces acquired by IOS are typically low-quality at gingival and deep intraoral regions. In recent years, some pioneering end-to-end methods (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the communities of computer vision and graphics to consume directly raw surface for 3D shape segmentation. Although these methods are potentially applicable to our task, most of them fail to capture fine-grained local geometric context that is critical to the identification of small teeth with varying shapes and appearances. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method, called MeshSegNet, for automated tooth labeling on raw dental surfaces. Using multiple raw surface attributes as inputs, MeshSegNet integrates a series of graph-constrained learning modules along its forward path to hierarchically extract multi-scale local contextual features. Then, a dense fusion strategy is applied to combine local-to-global geometric features for the learning of higher-level features for mesh cell annotation. The predictions produced by our MeshSegNet are further post-processed by a graph-cut refinement step for final segmentation. We evaluated MeshSegNet using a real-patient dataset consisting of raw maxillary surfaces acquired by 3D IOS. Experimental results, performed 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrate that MeshSegNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 3D shape segmentation.

TI  - Collaborative deep learning model for tooth segmentation and identification using panoramic radiographs
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Panoramic radiographs are an integral part of effective dental treatment planning, supporting dentists in iden-tifying impacted teeth, infections, malignancies, and other dental issues. However, screening for anomalies solely based on a dentist's assessment may result in diagnostic inconsistency, posing difficulties in developing a suc-cessful treatment plan. Recent advancements in deep learning-based segmentation and object detection algo-rithms have enabled the provision of predictable and practical identification to assist in the evaluation of a patient's mineralized oral health, enabling dentists to construct a more successful treatment plan. However, there has been a lack of efforts to develop collaborative models that enhance learning performance by leveraging individual models. The article describes a novel technique for enabling collaborative learning by incorporating tooth segmentation and identification models created independently from panoramic radiographs. This collab-orative technique permits the aggregation of tooth segmentation and identification to produce enhanced results by recognizing and numbering existing teeth (up to 32 teeth). The experimental findings indicate that the proposed collaborative model is significantly more effective than individual learning models (e.g., 98.77% vs. 96% and 98.44% vs.91% for tooth segmentation and recognition, respectively). Additionally, our models outperform the state-of-the-art segmentation and identification research. We demonstrated the effectiveness of collaborative learning in detecting and segmenting teeth in a variety of complex situations, including healthy dentition, missing teeth, orthodontic treatment in progress, and dentition with dental implants.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation of Internal Tooth Structure from CBCT Images Using Hierarchical Deep Learning
T2  - MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER ASSISTED INTERVENTION, MICCAI 2023, PT III
CP  - 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
AB  - Accurate segmentation of teeth is crucial for effective treatment planning. Previous approaches attempted to segment a tooth as a whole, which has limitations because most treatments involve internal structures of teeth. In this paper, we propose fully automated segmentation of internal tooth structure, including enamel, dentin, and pulp, which is the first attempt to the best of our knowledge. The task is challenging, because a total of 96 classes of tooth structures need to be identified from a CBCT image. We design a 3-stage process of coarse-to-fine segmentation of tooth structures without compromising the original resolution. We propose Dual-Hierarchy U-Net (DHU-Net) in order to capture hierarchical structures of teeth, and to effectively fuse encoder and decoder features from higher and lower hierarchies. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both tasks of segmenting the whole tooth and internal tooth structure.

TI  - Automatic three-dimensional nasal and pharyngeal airway subregions identification via Vision Transformer
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: Upper airway assessment requires a fully-automated segmentation system for complete or subregional identification. This study aimed to develop a novel Deep Learning (DL) model for accurate segmentation of the upper airway and achieve entire and subregional identification.Methods: Fifty cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, including 24,502 slices, were labelled as the ground truth by one orthodontist and two otorhinolaryngologists. A novel model, a lightweight multitask network based on the Swin Transformer and U-Net, was built for automatic segmentation of the entire upper airway and subregions. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over union (IoU). The clinical implications of the precision errors were quantitatively analysed, and comparisons between the AI model and Dolphin software were conducted. Results: Our model achieved good performance with a precision of 85.88-94.25%, recall of 93.74-98.44%, DSC of 90.95-96.29%, IoU of 83.68-92.85% in the overall and subregions of three-dimensional (3D) upper airway, and a precision of 91.22-97.51%, recall of 90.70-97.62%, DSC of 90.92-97.55%, and IoU of 83.41-95.29% in the subregions of two-dimensional (2D) crosssections. Discrepancies in volume and area caused by precision errors did not affect clinical outcomes. Both our AI model and the Dolphin software provided clinically acceptable consistency for pharyngeal airway assessments.Conclusion: The novel DL model not only achieved segmentation of the entire upper airway, including the nasal cavity and subregion identification, but also performed exceptionally well, making it well suited for 3D upper airway assessment from the nasal cavity to the hypopharynx, especially for intricate structures. Clinical significance: This system provides insights into the aetiology, risk, severity, treatment effect, and prognosis of dentoskeletal deformities and obstructive sleep apnea. It achieves rapid assessment of the entire upper airway and its subregions, making airway management-an integral part of orthodontic treatment, orthognathic surgery, and ENT surgery-easier.

TI  - Association between patient-, tooth- and treatment-level factors and root canal treatment failure: A retrospective longitudinal and machine learning study
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: We aimed to assess patient-, tooth-and treatment-level covariates on the failure of root canal treatments (RT) and to predict failure using machine learning (ML).
   Methods: Teeth receiving RT at one large university hospital from 2016 to 2020 with a minimum follow-up of >6 months were included. Failure compromised absent radiographic healing and/or the presence of clinical symptoms. Covariates were selected on tooth-, treatment-and patient-level. We used logistic regression (logR) to determine associations in the full dataset, and logR as well as more advanced ML (random forests (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extremely gradient boosting (XGB)) for predictive modeling (area-under-the receiver operating characteristic-curve (ROCAUC)) and testing on a separate test dataset.
   Results: 458 patients (female/male 47.2/52.8%) with 591 permanent teeth were included (overall success rate 79.5%). In logR, tooth-level covariates showed strong associations with failure: Alveolar bone loss 66-100% (ABL, OR 6.48, 95% CI [2.86, 14.89], p<0.001); Periapical index (PAI) score >= 4 (OR 4.59, [2.44, 8.79], p<0.001); ABL 33-66% (OR 2.59 [1.49, 4.49], p<0.001); PAI=3 (OR 2.45, [1.43, 4.34], p<0.01); Treatment type "retreatment" (OR 1.77, [1.01, 2.86], p<0.01). On patient level only smoking (OR 2.05, [1.18, 3.53], p<0.05) was significantly associated with risk of failure. For predictive modeling, the predictive power of all models was limited (ROCAUC: logR 0.63, [0.53, 0.73]; GBM 0.59, [0.50, 0.68]; RF 0.59, [0.50, 0.68]; XGB 0.60, [0.50, 0.70]).
   Conclusions: Failure of RT was associated mainly with tooth-level covariates. Predicting failure was only limitedly possible, also with more complex ML.
   Clinical significance: Identifying specific risk factors for failure of RT and predicting the outcome of RT is relevant for treatment planning and informed shared decision-making. The present study found tooth-level factors to be associated with failure. Notably, predicting failure was only limitedly possible.

AB  - The process of constructing precise geometry of human jaws from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is crucial for building finite element models and treatment planning. Despite the success of deep learning techniques, they struggle to accurately identify delicate features such as thin structures and gaps between the tooth-bone interfaces where periodontal ligament resides, especially when trained on limited data. Therefore, segmented geometries obtained through automated methods still require extensive manual adjustment to achieve a smooth and organic 3D geometry that is suitable for simulations. In this work, we require the model to provide anatomically correct segmentation of teeth and bones which preserves the space for the periodontal ligament layers. To accomplish the task with few accurate labels, we pre-train a modified MultiPlanar UNet as the backbone model using inferior segmentations, i.e., tooth-bone segmentation with no space in the tooth-bone interfaces, and fine-tune the model with a dedicated loss function over accurate delineations that considers the space. We demonstrate that our approach can produce proper tooth-bone segmentations with gap interfaces that are fit for simulations when applied to human jaw CBCT scans. Furthermore, we propose a marker-based watershed segmentation applied on the MultiPlanar UNet probability map to separate individual tooth. This has advantages when the segmentation task is challenged by common artifacts caused by restorative materials or similar intensities in the teeth-teeth interfaces in occurrence of crowded teeth phenomenon.

TI  - Comparative study of ChatGPT and human evaluators on the assessment of medical literature according to recognised reporting standards
T2  - BMJ HEALTH & CARE INFORMATICS
AB  - Introduction Amid clinicians' challenges in staying updated with medical research, artificial intelligence (AI) tools like the large language model (LLM) ChatGPT could automate appraisal of research quality, saving time and reducing bias. This study compares the proficiency of ChatGPT3 against human evaluation in scoring abstracts to determine its potential as a tool for evidence synthesis.Methods We compared ChatGPT's scoring of implant dentistry abstracts with human evaluators using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for Abstracts reporting standards checklist, yielding an overall compliance score (OCS). Bland-Altman analysis assessed agreement between human and AI-generated OCS percentages. Additional error analysis included mean difference of OCS subscores, Welch's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.Results Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of 4.92% (95% CI 0.62%, 0.37%) in OCS between human evaluation and ChatGPT. Error analysis displayed small mean differences in most domains, with the highest in 'conclusion' (0.764 (95% CI 0.186, 0.280)) and the lowest in 'blinding' (0.034 (95% CI 0.818, 0.895)). The strongest correlations between were in 'harms' (r=0.32, p<0.001) and 'trial registration' (r=0.34, p=0.002), whereas the weakest were in 'intervention' (r=0.02, p<0.001) and 'objective' (r=0.06, p<0.001).Conclusion LLMs like ChatGPT can help automate appraisal of medical literature, aiding in the identification of accurately reported research. Possible applications of ChatGPT include integration within medical databases for abstract evaluation. Current limitations include the token limit, restricting its usage to abstracts. As AI technology advances, future versions like GPT4 could offer more reliable, comprehensive evaluations, enhancing the identification of high-quality research and potentially improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Developing Children's Oral Health Assessment Toolkits Using Machine Learning Algorithm
T2  - JDR CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Objectives: Evaluating children's oral health status and treatment needs is challenging. We aim to build oral health assessment toolkits to predict Children's Oral Health Status Index (COHSI) score and referral for treatment needs (RFTN) of oral health. Parent and Child toolkits consist of short-form survey items (12 for children and 8 for parents) with and without children's demographic information (7 questions) to predict the child's oral health status and need for treatment. Methods: Data were collected from 12 dental practices in Los Angeles County from 2015 to 2016. We predicted COHSI score and RFTN using random Bootstrap samples with manually introduced Gaussian noise together with machine learning algorithms, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting and Naive Bayesian algorithms (using R). The toolkits predicted the probability of treatment needs and the COHSI score with percentile (ranking). The performance of the toolkits was evaluated internally and externally by residual mean square error (RMSE), correlation, sensitivity and specificity. Results: The toolkits were developed based on survey responses from 545 families with children aged 2 to 17 y. The sensitivity and specificity for predicting RFTN were 93% and 49% respectively with the external data. The correlation(s) between predicted and clinically determined COHSI was 0.88 (and 0.91 for its percentile). The RMSEs of the COHSI toolkit were 4.2 for COHSI (and 1.3 for its percentile). Conclusions: Survey responses from children and their parents/guardians are predictive for clinical outcomes. The toolkits can be used by oral health programs at baseline among school populations. The toolkits can also be used to quantify differences between pre- and post-dental care program implementation. The toolkits' predicted oral health scores can be used to stratify samples in oral health research. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This study creates the oral health toolkits that combine self- and proxy- reported short forms with children's demographic characteristics to predict children's oral health and treatment needs using Machine Learning algorithms. The toolkits can be used by oral health programs at baseline among school populations to quantify differences between pre and post dental care program implementation. The toolkits can also be used to stratify samples according to the treatment needs and oral health status.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis on the Impact of Various Aligner Materials and Attachments on Orthodontic Tooth Movement
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL BIOMATERIALS
AB  - The majority of patients strongly favor the use of aligners in the present time, especially with the advancement in esthetic dentistry. Today's market is flooded with aligner companies, many of which share the same therapeutic ethos. We therefore carried out a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate research that had looked at various aligner materials and attachments and their effect on orthodontic tooth movement in relevant studies. A total of 634 papers were discovered after a thorough search of online journals using keywords such as "Aligners", "Orthodontics", "Orthodontic attachments", "Orthodontic tooth movement", and "Polyethylene" across databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane. The authors individually and in parallel carried out the database investigation, removal of duplicate studies, data extraction, and bias risk. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the type of aligner material had a significant impact on orthodontic tooth movement. The low level of heterogeneity and significant overall effect further support this finding. However, there was little effect of attachment size or shape on tooth mobility. The examined materials were primarily concerned with influencing the physical/physicochemical characteristics of the appliances and not tooth movement directly. Invisalign (Inv) had a higher mean value than the other types of materials that were analyzed, which suggested a potentially greater impact on orthodontic tooth movement. However, its variance value indicated that there was also greater uncertainty associated with the estimate compared to some of the other plastics. These findings could have important implications for orthodontic treatment planning and aligner material selection. Registration: This review protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42022381466).

TI  - Lateral Cephalometric Landmark Annotation Using Histogram Oriented Gradients Extracted from Region of Interest Patches
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAXILLOFACIAL & ORAL SURGERY
AB  - IntroductionTwo-dimensional cephalometric image analysis plays a crucial role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. While deep learning-based algorithms have emerged to automate the laborious task of anatomical landmark annotation, their effectiveness is hampered by the challenges of acquiring and labelling clinical data. In this study, we propose a model that leverages conventional machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of landmark detection using limited dataset.Materials and methodsOur methodology involves coarse localization through region of interest (ROI) extraction and fine localization utilizing histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) feature. The image patch containing landmark pixels is classified using the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm. To evaluate our model's performance, we conducted rigorous tests on the ISBI Cephalometric dataset and Dental Cepha dataset, aiming to achieve accuracy within a 2 mm radial precision range. We also employed cross-validation to assess our approach, providing a robust evaluation.ResultsOur model's performance on the ISBI Cephalometric dataset showed an accuracy rate of 77.11% within the desired 2 mm radial precision range. The cross-validation results further confirmed the effectiveness of our approach, yielding a mean accuracy of 78.17%. Additionally, we applied our model to the Dental Cepha dataset, where we achieved a remarkable landmark detection accuracy of 84%.ConclusionThe results demonstrate that traditional machine learning techniques can be effective for accurate landmark detection in cephalometric images, even with limited data. Our findings highlight the potential of these techniques for clinical applications, where large datasets of labelled images may not be available.

TI  - Advancements in oral and maxillofacial surgery medical images segmentation techniques: An overview
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: This article reviews recent advances in computer-aided segmentation methods for oral and maxillofacial surgery and describes the advantages and limitations of these methods. The objective is to provide an invaluable resource for precise therapy and surgical planning in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Study selection, data and sources: This review includes full-text articles and conference proceedings reporting the application of segmentation methods in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. The research focuses on three aspects: tooth detection segmentation, mandibular canal segmentation and alveolar bone segmentation. The most commonly used imaging technique is CBCT, followed by conventional CT and Orthopantomography. A systematic electronic database search was performed up to July 2023 (Medline via PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ArXiv, Google Scholar were searched). Results: These segmentation methods can be mainly divided into two categories: traditional image processing and machine learning (including deep learning). Performance testing on a dataset of images labeled by medical professionals shows that it performs similarly to dentists' annotations, confirming its effectiveness. However, no studies have evaluated its practical application value. Conclusion: Segmentation methods (particularly deep learning methods) have demonstrated unprecedented performance, while inherent challenges remain, including the scarcity and inconsistency of datasets, visible artifacts in images, unbalanced data distribution, and the "black box" nature. Clinical significance: Accurate image segmentation is critical for precise treatment and surgical planning in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This review aims to facilitate more accurate and effective surgical treatment planning among dental researchers.

TI  - Evaluation of the efficiency of computerized algorithms to formulate a decision support system for deepbite treatment planning
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of a newly constructed computer-based decision support system (DSS) on the basis of artificial intelligence technology and designed to plan treatment for patients with a deep overbite. Methods: With the help of information technology, a DSS was developed specifically for treatment planning of deepbite malocclusion. The program inputs were the components and the contributing factors used commonly by the orthodontic clinicians in deepbite diagnosis. The program outputs were the treatment planning options for deepbite treatment. A total of 357 decisions made by the algorithm were evaluated for accuracy by comparing them to the actual treatment changes of 51 patients with a well-treated deepbite. Results: The decisions made by the algorithm were precise, with 94.4% having a very good agreement with actual treatment changes determined using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Conclusions: The constructed DSS was shown to be an efficient tool for planning treatment of deep overbite malocclusion in the permanent dentition; thus, the artificial intelligence could be used to formulate a customized plan for orthodontic clinicians.

T2  - 2019 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)
CP  - 10th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)
AB  - Cephalometric analysis is basic assessment aid for orthodontics, oral & maxillofacial surgery and treatment planning. The identification of landmark locations on lateral cephalograms plays a critical role in the clinical analysis, automating this process could reduce possible human errors and time consumption. This work explores the automation of landmark detection process using deep learning framework. The modified U-Net model has been trained on seven landmarks and implemented to locate the same in test images. The proposed model has been evaluated with dice metrics which was observed to be approximately 88 percent for each landmark. The successful detection rate has been calculated and compared with two other prominent methods, comparable results were achieved which comes under clinically acceptable range. This work is in the early stages as not many deep learning methods explored in this particular domain, which demonstrates assurance for improvement in computer-aided treatment and surgery planning.

TI  - DeAPIR: Efficient and Enhanced Dental Arch-Guided Panoramic Image Reconstruction from CBCT Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Dental CBCT and panoramic imaging play a pivotal role in dental diagnosis and treatment planning, alongside the indispensable use of computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging in dentistry, particularly for surgical planning. Given the widespread adoption of dental cone beam CT in clinics today, we explore a novel approach in this study-utilizing CT's three-dimensional (3D) data to reconstruct a two-dimensional (2D) panoramic dental image. This method eliminates the requirement for an extra panoramic scan. In this work, we propose a novel framework to generate an enhanced and extended 2D panoramic view by using the dental arch extracted from 3D CBCT. Our method involves segmenting the patient's dental arch from their 3D CBCT image by identifying horizontal slices with above-average intensity, followed by morphological operations, including dilation, Gaussian filtering, and skeletonization, to delineate the dental arch line. Additionally, we extend the dental arch beyond the wisdom teeth using quadratic curve fitting. Finally, we employ Maximum Intensity Projection on rotated cubic segments aligned with the dental arch curve to produce captivating panoramic images. The panoramic view produced using our proposed method, when compared to the results obtained from BlueSky and OpenInventor, exhibited superior enhancements and greater accuracy in panoramic visualization.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural network-based automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex from cone-beam computed tomography:A validation study
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated the accuracy, consistency, and time-efficiency of a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based model for the automated maxillofacial bone segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.
   Method: A dataset of 144 scans was acquired from two CBCT devices and randomly divided into three subsets: training set (n = 110), validation set (n = 10) and testing set (n = 24). A three-dimensional (3D) U-Net (CNN) model was developed, and the achieved automated segmentation was compared with a manual approach.
   Results: The average time required for automated segmentation was 39.1 s with a 204-fold decrease in time consumption compared to manual segmentation (132.7 min). The model was highly accurate for identification of the bony structures of the anatomical region of interest with a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 92.6%. Additionally, the fully deterministic nature of the CNN model was able to provide 100% consistency without any variability. The inter-observer consistency for expert-based minor correction of the automated segmentation observed an excellent DSC of 99.7%.
   Conclusion: The proposed CNN model provided a time-efficient, accurate, and consistent CBCT-based automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex.
   Clinical significance: Automated segmentation of the maxillofacial complex could act as an alternative to the conventional segmentation techniques for improving the efficiency of the digital workflows. This approach could deliver accurate and ready-to-print3D models, essential to patient-specific digital treatment planning for orthodontics, maxillofacial surgery, and implant dentistry.

TI  - CephXNet: A Deep Convolutional Squeeze-and-Excitation Model for Landmark Prediction on Lateral Cephalograms
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Cephalometric landmark identification is a crucial and significant procedure that is generally used for orthodontic treatment planning and diagnosis. Computer-aided fully automated solutions can assist orthodontists and orthognathic surgeons' to precisely identify the landmarks from cephalograms more efficiently. Most of the existing research studies deployed Convolutional Neural Network models, transfer learning methods, and pre-trained architectures to predict the XY coordinates of landmarks from cephalometric radiographs. Deep learning architectures have achieved good results in accurately predicting landmarks compared to machine learning methodologies. In this paper, a custom CNN model integrated with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SEB) attention block named CephXNet architecture is proposed to automatically classify and predicts the XY coordinates of 19 landmarks from lateral cephalograms. The SEB block, which can adaptively refine information from various feature channels of X-ray images models the interdependence between the channels to enhance the discriminative features and suppress noise. The Squeeze-and-Excitation block incorporated with multiple Convolution and Max pooling layers enhances independent channel feature learning and thereby improves the representational power of the proposed CephXNet architecture. The proposed framework obtained an accuracy of 97.72% for 19 landmark classifications and has achieved 88.06% and 78.72% of Successful Detection Rate (SDR) in clinically accepted 2mm precision range for test1 and test2 datasets provided in the 2015 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) grand challenge for dental X-ray analysis conducted by IEEE. Furthermore, the proposed CephXNet is also tested with private clinical dataset comprised of 100 cephalograms collected from Solanki Dental Care Clinic in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The proposed CephXNet model obtained a classification accuracy of 90.08% and an average SDR of 73.94% in the 2mm precision range. The experimental outcomes show proposed CephXNet model is efficient and has great potential to deploy in clinical practice.

T2  - CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL
AB  - Cherubism is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by bilateral maxillomandibular bony degeneration, fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia, and displacement of permanent tooth germs. Reossification of the cystic lumen occurs spontaneously, but dislocated teeth must be realigned orthodontically. Advancements in virtual 3D reconstruction of anatomic structures based on computed tomography (CT) or cone beam CT data have provided for more predictable individual treatment planning. We evaluated two software programs for making densitometry and volume measurements of cystic areas in the mandibles, and for 3D visualization of permanent tooth germs within the cystic lumen, in two siblings with cherubism.

TI  - Dental Impression Tray Selection From Maxillary Arch Images Using Multi-Feature Fusion and Ensemble Classifier
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Dental impression tray is frequently used in dentistry to record the patient's oral structure for clinical oral diagnosis and treatment planning. Manual procedure of taking impressions is costly, time-consuming, and additionally, no research has been done on selecting dental impression tray from dental arch images using computer vision in real-life scenarios. In this spirit, an intelligent model is proposed based on computer vision and machine learning to select appropriate dental impression trays from maxillary arch images. A dataset of 52 patients' maxillary arch images have been acquired and various sets of features such as colors, textures, and shapes of the images were extracted to better characterize the maxillary arch images. Considering the importance of the features in describing the maxillary arch object and to improve the classification performance, a method based on multi-feature fusion with ensemble classifier is proposed. Besides, the performance of a deep learning based multilayer perceptron neural network is also investigated. The proposed multi-feature fusion with ensemble classifier attained 92.31% precision, 91.75% recall, 91.75% accuracy, respectively, on the dataset, which clearly establishes the feasibility of the proposed model. An illustration of a real-life application of the proposed model is also provided.

TI  - Performance of a neural network trained to make third-molar treatment-planning decisions
T2  - MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - The authors developed and tested 12 neural networks of different architectures to make lower-third-molar treatment-planning decisions, using a software-based neural network (Neudesk 1.2, Neural Computer Sciences, Southampton, UK). Network training was undertaken using clinical histories from 119 patients (with 238 lower third molars) referred for treatment planning (79 females and 40 males, mean age 25 years) together with output data consisting of actual treatments planned by a senior oral surgeon. Both the input clinical data and the consultant decisions were treated on a tooth-wise basis and were coded to numerical values. Binary data (e.g., present/absent) were coded to 1 and 0, while quantitative data (e.g., age) were scaled to fall between 0 and 1. A network based on the optimal architecture was trained and then interrogated with test data derived from a further 174 patients (119 females and 55 males, mean age 26 years) with 348 lower third molars. Network decisions were dichotomized with a threshold of 0.8. With no knowledge of the network decisions, the senior oral surgeon indicated his preferred treatments. The teeth were then assigned to ''gold-standard'' categories of indications present or absent based on National Institutes of Health consensus criteria. Against this, the network achieved a sensitivity of 0.78, which was slightly inferior to that of the oral surgeon (0.88), although this difference was not significant, and a specificity of 0.98, compared with 0.99 for the oral surgeon (p = NS). Agreement between the oral surgeon and network decisions was very high (kappa = 0.850). This study demonstrates that it is possible to train a neural network to provide reliable decision support for lower-third-molar treatment planning.

TI  - An Attention-Guided Deep Regression Model for Landmark Detection in Cephalograms
T2  - MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2019, PT VI
CP  - 10th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI) / 22nd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
AB  - Cephalometric tracing method is usually used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based framework to automatically detect anatomical landmarks in cephalometric X-ray images. We train the deep encoder-decoder model for landmark detection, which combines global landmark configuration with local high-resolution feature responses. The proposed framework is based on a 2-stage u-net, regressing the multi-channel heatmaps for landmark detection. In this framework, we embed attention mechanism with global stage heatmaps, guiding the local stage inferring, to regress the local heatmap patches in a high resolution. Besides, an Expansive Exploration strategy is applied to improve robustness while inferring, expanding the searching scope without increasing model complexity. We have evaluated the proposed framework in the most widely-used public dataset of landmark detection in cephalometric X-ray images. With less computation and manually tuning, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results.

TI  - Improving Dental Implant Outcomes: CNN-Based System Accurately Measures Degree of Peri-Implantitis Damage on Periapical Film
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB  - As the popularity of dental implants continues to grow at a rate of about 14% per year, so do the risks associated with the procedure. Complications such as sinusitis and nerve damage are not uncommon, and inadequate cleaning can lead to peri-implantitis around the implant, jeopardizing its stability and potentially necessitating retreatment. To address this issue, this research proposes a new system for evaluating the degree of periodontal damage around implants using Periapical film (PA). The system utilizes two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models to accurately detect the location of the implant and assess the extent of damage caused by peri-implantitis. One of the CNN models is designed to determine the location of the implant in the PA with an accuracy of up to 89.31%, while the other model is responsible for assessing the degree of Peri-implantitis damage around the implant, achieving an accuracy of 90.45%. The system combines image cropping based on position information obtained from the first CNN with image enhancement techniques such as Histogram Equalization and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) to improve the visibility of the implant and gums. The result is a more accurate assessment of whether peri-implantitis has eroded to the first thread, a critical indicator of implant stability. To ensure the ethical and regulatory standards of our research, this proposal has been certified by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) under number 202102023B0C503. With no existing technology to evaluate Peri-implantitis damage around dental implants, this CNN-based system has the potential to revolutionize implant dentistry and improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Tooth-Related Disease Detection System Based on Panoramic Images and Optimization Through Automation: Development Study
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Early detection of tooth-related diseases in patients plays a key role in maintaining their dental health and preventing future complications. Since dentists are not overly attentive to tooth-related diseases that may be difficult to judge visually, many patients miss timely treatment. The 5 representative tooth-related diseases, that is, coronal caries or defect, proximal caries, cervical caries or abrasion, periapical radiolucency, and residual root can be detected on panoramic images. In this study, a web service was constructed for the detection of these diseases on panoramic images in real time, which helped shorten the treatment planning time and reduce the probability of misdiagnosis.
   Objective: This study designed a model to assess tooth-related diseases in panoramic images by using artificial intelligence in real time. This model can perform an auxiliary role in the diagnosis of tooth-related diseases by dentists and reduce the treatment planning time spent through telemedicine.
   Methods: For learning the 5 tooth-related diseases, 10,000 panoramic images were modeled: 4206 coronal caries or defects, 4478 proximal caries, 6920 cervical caries or abrasion, 8290 periapical radiolucencies, and 1446 residual roots. To learn the model, the fast region-based convolutional network (Fast R-CNN), residual neural network (ResNet), and inception models were used. Learning about the 5 tooth-related diseases completely did not provide accurate information on the diseases because of indistinct features present in the panoramic pictures. Therefore, 1 detection model was applied to each tooth-related disease, and the models for each of the diseases were integrated to increase accuracy.
   Results: The Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy, with an accuracy of over 90%, in diagnosing the 5 tooth-related diseases. Thus, Fast R-CNN was selected as the final judgment model as it facilitated the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases that are difficult to judge visually from radiographs and images, thereby assisting the dentists in their treatment plans.
   Conclusions: The Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy in the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases and can therefore play an auxiliary role in shortening the treatment planning time after the dentists diagnose the tooth-related disease. In addition, by updating the captured panoramic images of patients on the web service developed in this study, we are looking forward to increasing the accuracy of diagnosing these 5 tooth-related diseases. The dental diagnosis system in this study takes 2 minutes for diagnosing 5 diseases in 1 panoramic image. Therefore, this system plays an effective role in setting a dental treatment schedule.

TI  - Expanding the Application of Digital Dentistry with 3D Patient Monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS
AB  - Intraoral scanners have been used to capture data for the design and subsequent manufacture of dental restorations and also for registering color clinical images. Scanners can capture datasets for future use and comparisons. This manuscript describes the potential of using software algorithms to superimpose 3D images captured at different times to calculate dimensional changes at the click of a button in various dental fields. 3D patient monitoring, with the advance of artificial intelligence and its built-in capacity for data analyses, will allow dentists and researchers to calculate volumetric changes and predict potentially adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  - Caries and Restoration Detection Using Bitewing Film Based on Transfer Learning with CNNs
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Caries is a dental disease caused by bacterial infection. If the cause of the caries is detected early, the treatment will be relatively easy, which in turn prevents caries from spreading. The current common procedure of dentists is to first perform radiographic examination on the patient and mark the lesions manually. However, the work of judging lesions and markings requires professional experience and is very time-consuming and repetitive. Taking advantage of the rapid development of artificial intelligence imaging research and technical methods will help dentists make accurate markings and improve medical treatments. It can also shorten the judgment time of professionals. In addition to the use of Gaussian high-pass filter and Otsu's threshold image enhancement technology, this research solves the problem that the original cutting technology cannot extract certain single teeth, and it proposes a caries and lesions area analysis model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can identify caries and restorations from the bitewing images. Moreover, it provides dentists with more accurate objective judgment data to achieve the purpose of automatic diagnosis and treatment planning as a technology for assisting precision medicine. A standardized database established following a defined set of steps is also proposed in this study. There are three main steps to generate the image of a single tooth from a bitewing image, which can increase the accuracy of the analysis model. The steps include (1) preprocessing of the dental image to obtain a high-quality binarization, (2) a dental image cropping procedure to obtain individually separated tooth samples, and (3) a dental image masking step which masks the fine broken teeth from the sample and enhances the quality of the training. Among the current four common neural networks, namely, AlexNet, GoogleNet, Vgg19, and ResNet50, experimental results show that the proposed AlexNet model in this study for restoration and caries judgments has an accuracy as high as 95.56% and 90.30%, respectively. These are promising results that lead to the possibility of developing an automatic judgment method of bitewing film.

TI  - Anatomical Structure Sketcher for Cephalograms by Bimodal Deep Learning
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE BRITISH MACHINE VISION CONFERENCE 2013
CP  - 24th British Machine Vision Conference
AB  - The lateral cephalogram is a commonly used medium to acquire patient-specific morphology for diagnose and treatment planning in clinical dentistry. The robust anatomical structure detection and accurate annotation remain challenging considering the personal skeletal variations and image blurs caused by device-specific projection magnification, together with structure overlapping in the lateral cephalograms. We propose a novel cephalogram sketcher system, where the contour extraction of anatomical structures is formulated as a cross-modal morphology transfer from regular image patches to arbitrary curves. Specifically, the image patches of structures of interest are located by a hierarchical pictorial model. The automatic contour sketcher converts the image patch to a morphable boundary curve via a bimodal deep Boltzmann machine. The deep machine learns a joint representation of patch textures and contours, and forms a path from one modality (patches) to the other (contours). Thus, the sketcher can infer the contours by alternating Gibbs sampling along the path in a manner similar to the data completion. The proposed method is robust not only to structure detection, but also tends to produce accurate structure shapes and landmarks even in blurry X-ray images. The experiments performed on clinically captured cephalograms demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI  - Fusion extracted features from deep learning for identification of multiple positioning errors in dental panoramic imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental panoramic imaging plays a pivotal role in dentistry for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, correctly positioning patients can be challenging for technicians due to the complexity of the imaging equipment and variations in patient anatomy, leading to positioning errors. These errors can compromise image quality and potentially result in misdiagnoses.
   OBJECTIVE: This research aims to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of accurately and efficiently identifying multiple positioning errors in dental panoramic imaging.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study used 552 panoramic images selected from a hospital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). We defined six types of errors (E1-E6) namely, (1) slumped position, (2) chin tipped low, (3) open lip, (4) head turned to one side, (5) head tilted to one side, and (6) tongue against the palate. First, six Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were employed to extract image features, which were then fused using transfer learning. Next, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied to create a classifier for multiple positioning errors, using the fused image features. Finally, the classifier performance was evaluated using 3 indices of precision, recall rate, and accuracy.
   RESULTS: Experimental results showthat the fusion of image features with six binarySVMclassifiers yielded high accuracy, recall rates, and precision. Specifically, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.832 for identifying multiple positioning errors.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that six SVM classifiers effectively identify multiple positioning errors in dental panoramic imaging. The fusion of extracted image features and the employment of SVM classifiers improve diagnostic precision, suggesting potential enhancements in dental imaging efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Future research should consider larger datasets and explore real-time clinical application.

TI  - Imaging in Third Molar Surgery: A Clinical Update
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Third molar surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Considering the patient's young age and the often-elective nature of the procedure, a comprehensive preoperative evaluation of the surgical site, relying heavily on preoperative imaging, is key to providing accurate diagnostic work-up, evidence-based clinical decision making, and, when appropriate, indication-specific surgical planning. Given the rapid developments of dental imaging in the field, the aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date clinical overview of various imaging techniques related to perioperative imaging in third molar surgery, ranging from panoramic radiography to emerging technologies, such as photon-counting computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Each modality's advantages, limitations, and recent improvements are evaluated, highlighting their role in treatment planning, complication prevention, and postoperative follow-ups. The integration of recent technological advances, including artificial intelligence and machine learning in biomedical imaging, coupled with a thorough preoperative clinical evaluation, marks another step towards personalized dentistry in high-risk third molar surgery. This approach enables minimally invasive surgical approaches while reducing inefficiencies and risks by incorporating additional imaging modality- and patient-specific parameters, potentially facilitating and improving patient management.

TI  - Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of Treatment with Dental Implants with Acid Etched Surface
T2  - MATERIALS
AB  - Implant dentistry constitutes a therapeutic modality in the prosthodontic treatment of partially and totally edentulous patients. This study reports a long-term evaluation of treatment by the early loading of acid-etched surface implants. Forty-eight partially and totally edentulous patients were treated with 169 TSA Defcon (R) acid-etched surface implants for prosthodontic rehabilitation. Implants were loaded after a healing free-loading period of 6-8 weeks in mandible and maxilla, respectively. Implant and prosthodontic clinical findings were followed during at least 17 years. Clinical results indicate a survival and success rate of implants of 92.9%, demonstrating that acid-etched surface achieves and maintains successful osseointegration. Five implants in three patients were lost during the healing period. Sixty-five prostheses were placed in 45 patients over the remaining 164 implants, 30 single crowns, 21 partially fixed bridges, 9 overdentures, and 5 full-arch fixed rehabilitations. A total of 12 implants were lost during the follow-up period. Mean marginal bone loss was 1.91 +/- 1.24 mm, ranging from 1.1 to 3.6 mm. The most frequent complication was prosthetic technical complications (14.2%), followed by peri-implantitis (10.6%). The mean follow-up was of 214.4 months (208-228 months). Prosthodontic rehabilitation with an early-loading protocol over acid-etched surface implants is a successful implant treatment.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Tooth-Gingiva Trim Lines on Dental Surfaces
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB  - Detecting the tooth-gingiva trim line from a dental surface plays a critical role in dental treatment planning and aligner 3D printing. Existing methods treat this task as a segmentation problem, which is resolved with geometric deep learning based mesh segmentation techniques. However, these methods can only provide indirect results (i.e., segmented teeth) and suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy due to the incapability of making full use of high-resolution dental surfaces. To this end, we propose a two-stage geometric deep learning framework for automatically detecting tooth-gingiva trim lines from dental surfaces. Our framework consists of a trim line proposal network (TLP-Net) for predicting an initial trim line from the low-resolution dental surface as well as a trim line refinement network (TLR-Net) for refining the initial trim line with the information from the high-resolution dental surface. Specifically, our TLP-Net predicts the initial trim line by fusing the multi-scale features from a U-Net with a proposed residual multi-scale attention fusion module. Moreover, we propose feature bridge modules and a trim line loss to further improve the accuracy. The resulting trim line is then fed to our TLR-Net, which is a deep-based LDDMM model with the high-resolution dental surface as input. In addition, dense connections are incorporated into TLR-Net for improved performance. Our framework provides an automatic solution to trim line detection by making full use of raw high-resolution dental surfaces. Extensive experiments on a clinical dental surface dataset demonstrate that our TLP-Net and TLR-Net are superior trim line detection methods and outperform cutting-edge methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TI  - An Overview of Indices Used to Measure Treatment Effectiveness in Patients with Cleft Lip and Palate
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - In the contemporary era, the demand for orthodontic treatment is ever rising. Orthodontic treatment duration can range from a year to a few years. Our aim is to assess the available techniques of categorising treatment effectiveness in patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and to study their effect on improvement of treatment outcomes. The electronic databases including Medline-PUBMED, Science Direct, and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched from 1987 to 2013, and 40 311 relevant articles were found. Of these, we identified 22 articles including original articles as well as literature reviews. The different parameters and indices that are applied to speed-up orthodontic treatment outcomes in patients with CLP were identified as the GOSLON Yardstick, 5-year-old index, EUROCRAN index, Huddart Bodenham system, modified Huddart Bodenham system, GOAL Yardstick and, Bauru-Bilateral Cleft Lip and Palate Yardstick. This overview can create better awareness regarding the uses, advantages, and disadvantages of the different indices. It can enable better assessment and provide the impetus needed for a sustained upgrade in the standards of care for CLP in daily orthodontics.

TI  - Anatomical Landmarks Annotation on 2D Lateral Cephalograms with Channel Attention
T2  - 2022 22ND IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CLUSTER, CLOUD AND INTERNET COMPUTING (CCGRID 2022)
CP  - 22nd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)
AB  - Cephalometric tracing is widely used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Since manual landmark localization suffers from severe inter-observer and intra-observer inconsistency, a large number of efforts have been made by researchers to develop automatic localization methods. However, most of the existing methods are developed based on rules which sample uniformly from origin images rather than with the highest density in a focal point and ignore intermediate layers' results in their networks or their outputs' channels. To address the issue, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on multi-scale and multi-channel attention to identify landmarks. The channel attention network is first trained by multi-scale image patches cropped from 100 Cephalograms, and then enhanced by cross-layer connections to extract high-level features, finally involved in the collaboration with a three-layer MLP module to accurately locate coordinates. We conduct extensive evaluation on a real cephalometric X-ray data-set and a Non-public dataset, both achieve promising performance improvements especially in terms of high-precision detection.

TI  - Automatic Segmentation of Individual Tooth in Dental CBCT Images From Tooth Surface Map by a Multi-Task FCN
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Accurate and automatic segmentation of individual tooth is critical for computer-aided analysis towards clinical decision support and treatment planning. Three-dimensional reconstruction of individual tooth after the segmentation also plays an important role in simulation in digital orthodontics. However, it is difficult to automatically segment individual tooth in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images due to the blurring boundaries of neighboring teeth and the similar intensities between teeth and mandible bone. In this work, we propose the use of a multi-task 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) and marker-controlled watershed transform (MWT) to segment individual tooth. The multi-task FCN learns to simultaneously predict the probability of tooth region and the probability of tooth surface. Through the combination of the tooth probability gradient map and the surface probability map as the input image, MWT is used to automatically separate and segment individual tooth. Twenty-five dental CBCT scans are used in the study. The average Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard index, and relative volume difference are 0.936 (& x00B1;0.012), 0.881 (& x00B1;0.019), and 0.072 (& x00B1;0.027), respectively, and the average symmetric surface distance is 0.363 (& x00B1;0.145) mm for our method. The experimental results demonstrate that the multi-task 3D FCN combined with MWT can segment individual tooth of various types in dental CBCT images.

TI  - Oral health-related quality of life before and after crown therapy in young patients with amelogenesis imperfecta
T2  - HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES
AB  - Background: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization associated with poor esthetics and dental sensitivity. Because the condition is associated with negative social outcomes, this study evaluated oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), dental fear, and dental beliefs before and after early prosthetic crown therapy for AI during adolescence.
   Methods: The study included 69 patients with AI, aged 6-25 yr: 33 males and 36 females (mean age 14.5 +/- 4.3); healthy controls (n = 80), patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP; n = 30), and patients with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH; n = 39). All matched in age and gender, and all but the CLP group insocioeconomic area. Patients completed three questionnaires measuring OHRQoL (OHIP-14), dental fear (CFSS-DS), and dental beliefs (DBS-R). Twenty-six patients with severe AI between ages 9 and 22 yr received crown therapy and completed the questionnaires twice: before and after therapy.
   Results: OHIP-14 scores were significantly higher among patients with AI (7.0 +/- 6.7), MIH (6.8 +/- 7.6) and CLP (13.6 +/- 12.1) than healthy controls (1.4 +/- 2.4) (p < 0.001). After crown therapy, quality of life problems in the 26 patients with severe AI decreased significantly, from 7.8 +/- 6.1 to 3.0 +/- 4.8 (p < 0.001). Early prosthetic therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment.
   Conclusions: OHRQoL increased after early crown therapy in patients with severe AI. Therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment.

CP  - 20th Congress of the International-Commission-for-Optics
AB  - This paper introduced our newly developed method to acquire three-dimensional images of a dental cast. A rotatable table, a laser-knife, a mirror, a CCD camera and a personal computer made up of a three-dimensional data acquiring system. A dental cast is placed on the table; the mirror is installed beside the table; a linear laser is projected to the dental cast; the CCD camera is put up above the dental cast, it can take picture of the dental cast and the shadow in the mirror; while the table rotating, the camera records the shape of the laser streak projected on the dental cast, and transmit the data to the computer. After the table rotated one circuit, the computer processes the data, calculates the three-dimensional coordinates of the dental cast's surface. In data processing procedure, artificial neural networks are enrolled to calibrate the lens distortion, map coordinates form screen coordinate system to world coordinate system. According to the three-dimensional coordinates, the computer reconstructs the stereo image of the dental cast. It is essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics. In comparison with other systems in service, for example, laser beam three-dimensional scanning system, the characteristic of this three-dimensional data acquiring system: a. celerity, it casts only 1 minute to scan a dental cast; b. compact, the machinery is simple and compact; c. no blind zone, a mirror is introduced ably to reduce blind zone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) experience many oral difficulties including sensitivity and aesthetics. The methods of treating AI children are limited and therefore a program of care was evaluated in order to assess the clinical efficacy of providing preventive and restorative treatments. CASE REPORTS: A non-randomised convenience sample of 12 patients with AI was evaluated. A comprehensive patient history was recorded, followed by a clinical and radiographic assessment of oral health. In 8/12 patients a hypoplastic form of AI was diagnosed, in 2/12 cases hypomaturation and in 2/12 cases hypocalcified form were noted. Chief complaints were mainly related to unsatisfactory aesthetics and dental sensitivity. In 8 patients there was active dental caries. Most of the patients had gingivitis and showed fair oral hygiene. The presence of non-enamel dental anomalies was recorded in 9 patients. TREATMENT: All patients received meticulous preventive care. Initial treatment depended on AI type and oral health of the patient. During the transition period, both conventional and resin modified glassionomer cements, as well as composite resin materials, were used to restore posterior teeth. Direct composite resin restorations were used to improve the appearance of anterior teeth. In 4 patients a long-lasting interdisciplinary approach including orthodontics, metal-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures, and direct composite restorations was required. FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up periods varied between 2-11 years. All children have been regularly recalled at 3 monthly intervals. Caries prevalence has remained low during the follow-up postoperative period and patients have reported satisfaction with the treatment they have received. CONCLUSION: AI is associated with multiple non-enamel anomalies and requires a complex treatment. Treatment planning is related to the age of the patient, the type and severity of the disorder, and the oral health of the patient. Early diagnosis, preventive care and timely treatment are of foremost importance to improve oral health in children with AI.

CP  - 20th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)
AB  - The computer-assisted radiologic informative report has received increasing research attention to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning for dental care providers. However, manual interpretation of dental images is limited, expensive, and time-consuming. Another barrier in dental imaging is the limited number of available images for training, which is a challenge in the era of deep learning. This study proposes a novel self-distillation (SD) enhanced self-supervised learning on top of the masked image modeling (SimMIM) Transformer, called SD-SimMIM, to improve the outcome with a limited number of dental radiographs. In addition to the prediction loss on masked patches, SD-SimMIM computes the self-distillation loss on the visible patches. We apply SDSimMIM on dental panoramic X-rays for teeth numbering, detection of dental restorations and orthodontic appliances, and instance segmentation tasks. Our results show that SDSimMIM outperforms other self-supervised learning methods. Furthermore, we augment and improve the annotation of an existing dataset of panoramic X-rays.

TI  - Learning Cephalometric Landmarks for Diagnostic Features Using Regression Trees
T2  - BIOENGINEERING-BASEL
AB  - Lateral cephalograms provide important information regarding dental, skeletal, and softtissue parameters that are critical for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Several machine learning methods have previously been used for the automated localization of diagnostically relevant landmarks on lateral cephalograms. In this study, we applied an ensemble of regression trees to solve this problem. We found that despite the limited size of manually labeled images, we can improve the performance of landmark detection by augmenting the training set using a battery of simple image transforms. We further demonstrated the calculation of second-order features encoding the relative locations of landmarks, which are diagnostically more important than individual landmarks.

TI  - XGBoost-aided prediction of lip prominence based on hard-tissue measurements and demographic characteristics in an Asian population
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
AB  - Introduction: Prediction of lip prominence based on hard-tissue measurements could be helpful in orthodontic treatment planning and has been challenging and formidable thus far. Methods: A machine learning-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 1549 patients. Hard-tissue measurements and demographic information were used as the input features. Seven popular machine learning algorithms were applied to the datasets to predict upper and lower lip prominence. The algorithm that performed the best was selected for the construction of the prediction model. Evaluation of feature importance was conducted using 3 classical methods. Results: Among the 7 algorithms, the XGBoost model performed the best in the prediction of the distances between labrale superius or labrale inferius to the esthetics plane (UL-EP and LL-EP distances), with root mean square error values of 1.25, 1.49 and r2 values of 0.755 and 0.683, respectively. Among the 14 input features, the L1-NB distance contributed the most to the prominences of the upper and lower lips. A lip prominence predictor was developed to facilitate clinical application by deploying the prediction model into a downloadable tool kit. Conclusions: The XGBoost model performed well with high accuracy and practicability in predicting upper and lower lip prominence. The artificial intelligence-aided predictor could serve as a reference for orthodontic treatment planning. (Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop 2023;164:357-67)

TI  - A simple method for quick evaluation of the anterior tooth ratio: an observational study
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - Background An ideal relationship of anterior teeth is closely related to postoperative function, stability, and aesthetics. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the proportion of anterior teeth when communicating with patients about possible treatment plans and outcomes. This study aimed to establish a simple method for assessing the proportion of anterior teeth and to identify the standard ratio value to provide references for clinical work. Methods Five hundred fourteen patients were divided into derivation, standard, and validation datasets. We first deduced our novel simplified anterior tooth ratio (SATR) by finding the key teeth with the derivation datasets, then established standard values by measuring the standard models, and finally validated the diagnostic performance of SATR. Independent sample t-test was used to select key teeth. Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression analysis was used to test and verify the correlation between SATR and the anterior Bolton ratio. Chi-square test and diagnostic test were used to verify the diagnostic results using SATR. P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Patients with an abnormal anterior Bolton ratio were more likely to have variations in the maxillary and mandibular lateral incisors. Therefore, the ratio of maxillary and mandibular lateral incisors was chosen as a simple way to assess the anterior tooth ratio and was defined as SATR (simplified anterior tooth ratio). A positive correlation was observed between SATR and anterior Bolton ratio (r = 0.702, p < 0.001), with the linear regression equation as follows: y = 0.503 + 0.328x, x = SATR, y = anterior Bolton ratio. The standard value of SATR was established (85.69% +/- 3.57%) and proven reliable in clinical practice. Conclusions The ratio of maxillary and mandibular lateral incisors can be used to estimate the anterior tooth ratio, which showed high reliability and efficiency.

TI  - Integration of imaging modalities in digital dental workflows - possibilities, limitations, and potential future developments
T2  - DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - The digital workflow process follows different steps for all dental specialties. However, the main ingredient for the diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up workflow recipes is the imaging chain. The steps in the imaging chain usually include all or at least some of the following modalities: cone-beam computed tomographic data acquisition, segmentation of the cone-beam computed tomography image, intra oral scanning, facial three-dimensional soft tissue capture and superimposition of all the images for the creation of a virtual augmented model. As a relevant clinical problem, the accumulation of error at each step of the chain might negatively influence the final outcome. For an efficient digital workflow, it is important to be aware of the existing challenges within the imaging chain. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based strategies need to be integrated in the future to make the workflow more simplified, accurate and efficient.

TI  - Cascaded convolutional networks for automatic cephalometric landmark detection
T2  - MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
AB  - Cephalometric analysis is a fundamental examination which is widely used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Its key step is to detect the anatomical landmarks in lateral cephalograms, which is time-consuming in traditional manual way. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach with a cascaded three-stage convolutional neural networks to predict cephalometric landmarks automatically. In the first stage, high-level features of the craniofacial structures are extracted to locate the lateral face area which helps to overcome the appearance variations. Next, we process the aligned face area to esti-mate the locations of all landmarks simultaneously. At the last stage, each landmark is refined through a dedicated network using high-resolution image data around the initial position to achieve more accurate result. We evaluate the proposed method on several anatomical landmark datasets and the experimental results show that our method achieved competitive performance compared with the other methods.

TI  - MeshSNet: Deep Multi-scale Mesh Feature Learning for End-to-End Tooth Labeling on 3D Dental Surfaces
T2  - MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2019, PT VI
CP  - 10th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI) / 22nd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
AB  - Accurate tooth labeling on 3D dental surfaces is a vital task in computer-aided orthodontic treatment planning. Existing automated or semi-automated methods usually require human interactions, which is time-consuming. Also, they typically use simple geometric properties as the criteria for segmentation, which cannot well handle the high variation of tooth appearance across different patients. Recently, several pioneering deep neural networks (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the computer vision and computer graphics communities to efficiently segment 3D shapes in an end-to-end manner. However, these methods do not perform well in our specific task of tooth labeling, especially considering that they cannot explicitly model fine-grained local geometric context of teeth (although only a small portion of dental surfaces but with different shapes and appearances). In this paper, we propose a specific deep neural network (called MeshSNet) for end-to-end tooth segmentation on 3D dental surfaces captured by advanced intraoral scanners. Using directly raw mesh data as input, our MeshSNet adopts novel graph-constrained learning modules to hierarchically extract multi-scale contextual features, and then densely integrates local-to-global geometric features to comprehensively characterize mesh cells for the segmentation task. We evaluated our proposed method on an in-house clinic dataset via 3-fold cross-validation. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our MeshSNet method, compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 3D shape segmentation.

TI  - Soft Tissue Conditions and Marginal Bone Changes around Immediately Loaded Implants Inserted in Edentate Jaws Following Computer Guided Treatment Planning and Flapless Surgery: A=1-Year Clinical Follow-Up Study
T2  - CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Evaluation of the clinical conditions following computer guided treatment planning and flapless surgery is still limited.
   Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the soft tissue conditions and marginal bone changes after 1 year of function around immediately loaded implants inserted in edentate jaws following computer guided treatment planning and flapless surgery.
   Material and Methods: Twenty-nine edentate jaws (19 maxillae, 10 mandibles) treated with 165 implants using the Teeth-in-an-Hour (TM) protocol were included. In these patients, peri-implant soft tissue conditions and radiographic marginal bone changes were evaluated after >= 1 year of functional loading (mean: 19 months).
   Results: The mean probing depth at case level was 2.6 mm (SD: 0.6). Bleeding on probing was recorded as a mean of 81.9% (SD: 23.0). Plaque index showed a wide range of 0-100%. The mean marginal bone change of measured sites evaluated on intraoral radiographs was -1.2 mm(SD: 1.4). A marginal bone loss more than 1.5 mmor 2.0 mmwas observed in 42% and 27% of the measured sites, respectively. A pressure-like-ulcer was found in 9 cases. Implants with marginal bone loss of > 1.5 mm were more frequently observed in cases with an ulcer than cases where no ulcer was found.
   Conclusion: Although the mean marginal bone loss after function in the present study was within the range of other reports presenting mean bone loss data after immediate implant loading, our patients showed a wide range of bone loss with several sites, where the bone loss was greater than the commonly used successful level (> 1.5 mm).

TI  - Temporal Consistent 2D-3D Registration of Lateral Cephalograms and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Images
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING IN MEDICAL IMAGING: 9TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP, MLMI 2018
CP  - 9th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI)
AB  - Craniofacial growths and developments play an important role in treatment planning of orthopedics and orthodontics. Traditional growth studies are mainly on longitudinal growth datasets of 2D lateral cephalometric radiographs (LCR). In this paper, we propose a temporal consistent 2D-3D registration technique enabling 3D growth measurements of craniofacial structures. We initialize the independent 2D-3D registration by the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regression, which produces the dense displacement field of the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image when given the LCR. The temporal constraints of the growth-stable structures are used to refine the 2D-3D registration. Instead of traditional independent 2D-3D registration, we jointly solve the nonrigid displacement fields of a series of input LCRs captured at different ages. The hierarchical pyramid of the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) is introduced to fasten the convergence. The proposed method has been applied to the growth dataset in clinical orthodontics. The resulted 2D-3D registration is consistent with both the input LCRs concerning the structural contours and the 3D volumetric images regarding the growth-stable structures.

TI  - Functional and Esthetic Rehabilitation of a Patient with Amelogenesis Imperfecta
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CANADIAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a hereditary disorder that causes developmental alterations in the structure of enamel. In addition, tooth sensitivity, missing or impacted teeth, taurodontism, altered dental esthetics and anterior open bite can also be associated with AI. This clinical report presents the diagnosis, treatment planning and prosthetic rehabilitation of a 19-year-old female patient with AI associated with a group of dental anomalies. Following clinical and radiographic examination, histologic evaluation of the teeth confirmed the diagnosis of rough pattern hypoplastic AI. The patient was rehabilitated with full-mouth zirconium oxide ceramic fixed bridges. Adaptation of the temporomandibular joints and masticatory muscles to the bridges was carefully observed over 3 years. At the end of this follow-up period, the patient was satisfied with the esthetics, function and phonation of her prostheses.

TI  - Amelogenesis imperfecta - lifelong management. Restorative management of the adult patient
T2  - BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL
AB  - The biggest challenge restorative dentists face in rehabilitating patients with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is trying to restore aesthetics, function and occlusal stability while keeping the treatment as conservative as possible. The goals of treatment should be to prolong the life of the patient's own teeth and avoid or delay the need for extractions and subsequent replacement with conventional fixed, removable or implant retained prostheses. In order to achieve these goals a stepwise approach to treatment planning is required starting with the most conservative but aesthetically acceptable treatment. This article discusses the management of AI and presents the various treatment options available for restoring the adult patient who presents to the dentist with AI.

TI  - A Conservative Treatment for Amelogenesis Imperfecta with Direct Resin Composite Restorations: A Case Report
T2  - JOURNAL OF ESTHETIC AND RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY
AB  - Rehabilitation of a patient with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) from both the functional and esthetic standpoints represents a challenge. The complexity of the condition requires an interdisciplinary approach for optimal treatment outcomes. A number of treatment options have been proposed. Recently, the use of bonded restorations has gained popularity because of the many benefits associated with these materials; excellent esthetics, conservative approach, and improved wear make their use advantageous. This article describes a direct approach with resin composite restorations for the transitional treatment of an adolescent with hypoplastic AI who had not completed skeletal growth. Protection against further wear, sensitivity, and plaque accumulation while significantly enhancing the patient's esthetic appearance made this case a success. Furthermore, this article describes the use of a "Clear matrix" technique, which considerably helped simplify the placement of the bonded restorations.
   This article highlights (1) the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to the successful treatment planning of a patient with hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), and (2) the conservativeness and suitability of full coverage direct resin composite restorations for the transitional treatment of AI-affected teeth on an adolescent patient who has not yet completed skeletal growth.

TI  - Automatic mandibular canal detection using a deep convolutional neural network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The practicability of deep learning techniques has been demonstrated by their successful implementation in varied fields, including diagnostic imaging for clinicians. In accordance with the increasing demands in the healthcare industry, techniques for automatic prediction and detection are being widely researched. Particularly in dentistry, for various reasons, automated mandibular canal detection has become highly desirable. The positioning of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), which is one of the major structures in the mandible, is crucial to prevent nerve injury during surgical procedures. However, automatic segmentation using Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) poses certain difficulties, such as the complex appearance of the human skull, limited number of datasets, unclear edges, and noisy images. Using work-in-progress automation software, experiments were conducted with models based on 2D SegNet, 2D and 3D U-Nets as preliminary research for a dental segmentation automation tool. The 2D U-Net with adjacent images demonstrates higher global accuracy of 0.82 than naive U-Net variants. The 2D SegNet showed the second highest global accuracy of 0.96, and the 3D U-Net showed the best global accuracy of 0.99. The automated canal detection system through deep learning will contribute significantly to efficient treatment planning and to reducing patients' discomfort by a dentist. This study will be a preliminary report and an opportunity to explore the application of deep learning to other dental fields.

TI  - Multifunctional anatomical prototypes (MAPs): Treatment of excessive gingival display due to altered passive eruption
T2  - JOURNAL OF ESTHETIC AND RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY
AB  - ObjectiveTo describe a strategy using digital technologies for improving the diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical execution of patients with excessive gingival display (EGD) due to altered passive eruption (APE). Clinical ConsiderationsAn important component for successful patient's management is to fulfill their esthetic expectations whilst delivering predictable and long-term therapeutic outcomes. To achieve this goal in patients with excessive gingival display due to altered passive eruption, it is essential to perform an accurate diagnosis and to communicate to the patient the expected customized results using digital technologies. Computer-aided designed and manufactured multifunctional anatomical prototypes (MAPs) may contribute to these purposes. Additionally, they can guide the surgical crown lengthening procedure or serve as a reference during the surgical guide fabrication providing information of the required anatomical landmarks. ConclusionsThis novel strategy protocol for diagnosis, communication, and treatment management of patients with excessive gingival display follows functional and biological principles within the frame of a digital workflow, which improves the diagnostic capabilities, enhances communication, and guides the surgical treatment as shown in the 12 months follow-up of the reported case. Clinical SignificanceDeveloping a virtual patient by combining multiple digital data sets including cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), intra-oral scans and digital photography, supports the clinician and the patient to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis and to better communicate the expected results to the patient. Furthermore, this digital treatment exercise based on anatomical and biological principles will facilitate the surgical precision and the achievement of successful outcomes, thus fulfilling the patient needs and expectations.

TI  - An automatic cephalometric landmark detection method based on heatmap regression and Monte Carlo dropout
T2  - 2023 45TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY, EMBC
CP  - 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)
AB  - Cephalometric analysis plays an important role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. It depends on the detection of multiple landmarks, while the process is time-consuming and tedious. Although some deep learning-based automatic landmark detection algorithms have achieved excellent performance, most of them adopt multi-stage models increasing the complexity and detection time. Meanwhile, few studies focused on the uncertainty of detection results, thereby ignoring its significant clinical value. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on heatmap regression for landmark detection, which can achieve competitive accuracy and good robustness with only one step. Furthermore, by applying Monte Carlo dropout to a U-shaped convolutional neural network, we can obtain not only the coordinate of each landmark but also the corresponding simple uncertainty, so that doctors can pay more attention to those landmarks with higher uncertainty. The evaluation results showed the mean radial error is 1.39 +/- 1.06mm and the average successful detection rate is 79.65%, 97.22% within 2mm, 4mm for the IEEE ISBI2015 Test Dataset 1, the indicators for the IEEE ISBI2015 Test Dataset 2 are 1.33 +/- 0.93mm, 80.05% and 97.53%, respectively. Our method has the potential to become an assistant tool in clinical practice. Automatic and accurate detection with uncertainty analysis is expected to help guide the doctor's judgment.

TI  - Automated detection of cephalometric landmarks using deep neural patchworks
T2  - DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives This study evaluated the accuracy of deep neural patchworks (DNPs), a deep learning -based segmentation framework, for automated identification of 60 cephalometric landmarks (bone-, soft tissue-and tooth-landmarks) on CT scans. The aim was to determine whether DNP could be used for routine three-dimensional cephalometric analysis in diagnostics and treatment planning in orthognathic surgery and orthodontics. Methods: Full skull CT scans of 30 adult patients (18 female, 12 male, mean age 35.6 years) were randomly divided into a training and test data set (each n = 15). Clinician A annotated 60 landmarks in all 30 CT scans. Clinician B annotated 60 landmarks in the test data set only. The DNP was trained using spherical segmentations of the adjacent tissue for each landmark. Automated landmark predictions in the separate test data set were created by calculating the center of mass of the predictions. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by comparing these annotations to the manual annotations.Results: The DNP was successfully trained to identify all 60 landmarks. The mean error of our method was 1.94 mm (SD 1.45 mm) compared to a mean error of 1.32 mm (SD 1.08 mm) for manual annotations. The minimum error was found for landmarks ANS 1.11 mm, SN 1.2 mm, and CP_R 1.25 mm.Conclusion: The DNP-algorithm was able to accurately identify cephalometric landmarks with mean errors <2 mm. This method could improve the workflow of cephalometric analysis in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Low training requirements while still accomplishing high precision make this method particularly promising for clinical use.

TI  - Interdisciplinary full digital restorative treatment of a young patient with severe open bite and amelogenesis imperfecta: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF OSSEOINTEGRATION
AB  - Background Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) is a syndromic entity comprising several clinical conditions, mostly genetic-based, affecting quality and quantity of enamel. The use of digital tools can be advantageous to enhance communication between the dental team and patients. Moreover, a full digital approach would allow to check each single clinical step according to the treatment plan with a backward approach. The aim of this case report is to describe a multidisciplinary treatment program of a young patient with severe open bite and amelogenesis imperfecta, whose restorative rehabilitation was planned in a full-digital workflow, from the initial communication phase up to the final prosthodontic rehabilitation.
   Case report An 8-year old female patient was diagnosed with a Class II division 1 malocclusion, severe open bite and AI. The treatment plan included 3 phases: the elimination of the tongue interposition habit and the anterior open bite, the orthodontic correction of dental deviation and leveling of both dental arches and a prosthetic rehabilitation. The extraction of the four first molars corrected the canine and molar Angle Class II relationships, deviation of the midline and repositioning of the maxillary incisors on the sagittal plane. Feldspathic ceramics was used in anterior sites to enhance the esthetic outcome. CAD/CAM hybrid ceramo-polymeric restorative material (PICN) was chosen for posterior regions.
   Conclusion The outcomes of the present case report proved that the planned objectives were satisfactorily obtained thanks to proper treatment planning, full digital workflow and the patient's optimal compliance with the extraoral device.

TI  - Automated assessment of mandibular shape asymmetry in 3-dimensions
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS
AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to develop an automatic pipeline for analyzing mandibular shape asymmetry in 3-dimensions. Methods: Forty patients with skeletal Class I pattern and 80 patients with skeletal Class III pattern were used. The mandible was automatically segmented from the cone-beam computed tomography images using a U-net deep learning network. A total of 17,415 uniformly sampled quasi-landmarks were automatically identified on the mandibular surface via a template mapping technique. After alignment with the robust Procrustes superimposition, the pointwise surface-to-surface distance between original and reflected mandibles was visualized in a color-coded map, indicating the location of asymmetry. The degree of overall mandibular asymmetry and the asymmetry of subskeletal units were scored using the root-mean-squared-error between the left and right sides. These asymmetry parameters were compared between the skeletal Class I and skeletal Class III groups. Results: The mandible shape was significantly more asymmetrical in pa-tients with skeletal Class III pattern with positional asymmetry. The condyles were identified as the most asym-metric region in all groups, followed by the coronoid process and the ramus. Conclusions: This automated approach to quantify mandibular shape asymmetry will facilitate high-throughput image processing for big data analysis. The spatially-dense landmarks allow for evaluating mandibular asymmetry over the entire surface, which overcomes the information loss inherent in conventional linear distance or angular measurements. Precise quantification of the asymmetry can provide important information for individualized diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics and orthognathic surgery.

TI  - UNILATERAL POSTERIOR CROSSBITE IN PRIMARY DENTITION. CASE REPORT
T2  - ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF ORAL REHABILITATION
AB  - Aim of the study Preventive orthodontic care necessitates rational treatment planning among children even in an early stage of dental and skeletal development. Material and methods The oral rehabilitation of patients with unilateral posterior crossbite in primary dentition remains a challenge, for the clinician and for the patient, due to functional, aesthetic and self-maintenance alterations, and requires early orthodontic treatment. To illustrate the treatment difficulties of such a pathology, we present a clinical case, a five years old girl diagnosed with unilateral posterior cross- bite, narrow maxilla and left mandibular shift. Results In order to fulfil the therapeutic objectives, a rapid palatal expander with a median screw welding on band cemented on 5.5, 6.5 was applied. After 3 month the transversal unilateral discrepancy was corrected, with stable occlusal contacts. Conclusions For skeletal transverse problems the appliance of choice is a rapid maxillary expander especially for growing patients.

TI  - Research routes on improved sleep bruxism metrics: Toward a standardised approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH
AB  - A recent report from the European Sleep Research Society's task force "Beyond AHI" discussed an issue that has been a long-term subject of debate - what are the best metrics for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) diagnosis and treatment outcome assessments? In a similar way, sleep bruxism (SB) metrics have also been a recurrent issue for >30 years and there is still uncertainty in dentistry regarding their optimisation and clinical relevance. SB can occur alone or with comorbidities such as OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, insomnia, headache, orofacial pain, periodic limb movement, rapid eye movement behaviour disorder, and sleep epilepsy. Classically, the diagnosis of SB is based on the patient's dental and medical history and clinical manifestations; electromyography is used in research and for complex cases. The emergence of new technologies, such as sensors and artificial intelligence, has opened new opportunities. The main objective of the present review is to stimulate the creation of a collaborative taskforce on SB metrics. Several examples are available in sleep medicine. The development of more homogenised metrics could improve the accuracy and refinement of SB assessment, while moving forward toward a personalised approach. It is time to develop SB metrics that are relevant to clinical outcomes and benefit patients who suffer from one or more possible negative consequences of SB.

TI  - A systematic review of oral health outcomes produced by dental teams incorporating midlevel providers
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background. The authors conducted a systematic review on this research question: "In populations where nondentists conduct diagnostic, treatment planning, and/or irreversible/surgical dental procedures, is there a change in disease increment, untreated dental disease, and/or cost-effectiveness of dental care?"
   Methods. The authors searched 12 electronic databases for articles published through February 2012 and hand searched relevant articles. They assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data.
   Results. The authors screened 7,701 citations, resulting in 18 observational studies that met the inclusion criteria. They judged 13 of the studies to be at high risk of bias, five at moderate risk and one at low risk. The authors found no data regarding cost effectiveness, irreversible diagnostic procedures or diseases other than caries.
   Conclusions. The authors concluded that the quality of the evidence was poor. They found that in select groups in which participants received irreversible dental treatment from teams that included midlevel providers, caries increment, caries severity or both decreased across time; however, there was no difference in caries increment, caries severity or both compared with those in populations in which dentists provided all irreversible treatment. In select groups in which participants had received irreversible dental treatment from. teams that included midlevel providers, there was a decrease in untreated caries across time and a decrease in untreated caries compared with that in populations in which dentists provided all treatment.
   Clinical Implications. Generalizability of results to populations other than those studied is limited owing to the age of some of the studies, as well as to clinical and methodological heterogeneity; consequently, the conclusions should be viewed with caution.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes After Treatment of Non-Contained Intrabony Defects With Enamel Matrix Derivative or Guided Tissue Regeneration: A 12-Month Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERIODONTOLOGY
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to compare the healing of deep, non-contained intrabony defects (i.e., with a >= 80% 1-wall component and a residual 2- to 3-wall component in the most apical part) treated with either an enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or guided tissue regeneration (GTR) after 12 months.
   Methods: In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, 40 subjects with 40 defects affecting single-rooted teeth were treated. The defects were treated with EMD alone or with a non-resorbable titanium-reinforced membrane. No grafting materials were used. At baseline and after 12 months, clinical parameters including probing depths (PDs) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) were recorded. The difference in CAL gain was the primary outcome.
   Results: At baseline, the intrabony component of the defects amounted to 8.5 +/- 2.2 mm at EMD-treated sites and 8.6 +/- 1.7 mm at GTR-treated sites (P = 0.47). The mean CAL gain at sites treated with GTR was significantly greater (P<0.001) than that at sites treated with EMD (4.1 +/- 1.4 mm versus 2.4 +/- 2.2 mm, respectively). GTR therapy, compared to EMD application alone, significantly (P = 0.01) increased the probability of CAL gain >= 4 mm (79.2% versus 11.3%, respectively) and significantly (P = 0.01) decreased the probability of residual PDs >= 6 mm (3% versus 79.3%, respectively).
   Conclusion: Although the outcomes of open-flap debridement alone were not investigated, the application of EMD alone appeared to yield less PD reduction and CAL gain compared to GTR therapy in the treatment of deep, non-contained intrabony defects. J Periodontol 2011;82:62-71.

TI  - A progressive framework for tooth and substructure segmentation from cone-beam CT images
T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Accurate segmentation of individual tooth and their substructures including enamel, pulp, and dentin from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is essential for dental diagnosis and treatment planning in digital dentistry. Existing methods for tooth segmentation based on CBCT images have achieved substantial progress; however, techniques for further segmentation into substructures are yet to be developed. Purpose: We aim to propose a novel three-stage progressive deep-learning-based framework for automatically segmenting 3D tooth from CBCT images, focusing on finer substructures, i.e., enamel, pulp, and dentin. Methods: In this paper, we first detect each tooth using its centroid by a clustering scheme, which efficiently determines each tooth detection by applying learned displacement vectors from the foreground tooth region. Next, guided by the detected centroid, each tooth proposal, combined with the corresponding tooth map, is processed through our tooth segmentation network. We also present an attention-based hybrid feature fusion mechanism, which provides intricate details of the tooth boundary while maintaining the global tooth shape, thereby enhancing the segmentation process. Additionally, we utilize the skeleton of the tooth as a guide for subsequent substructure segmentation. Results: Our algorithm is extensively evaluated on a collected dataset of 314 patients, and the extensive comparison and ablation studies demonstrate superior segmentation results of our approach. Conclusions: Our proposed method can automatically segment tooth and finer substructures from CBCT images, underlining its potential applicability for clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment.

TI  - Automatic tooth roots segmentation of cone beam computed tomography image sequences using U-net and RNN
T2  - JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic segmentation of individual tooth root is a key technology for the reconstruction of the three-dimensional dental model from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images, which is of great significance for the orthodontic, implant and other dental diagnosis and treatment planning.
   OBJECTIVES: Currently, tooth root segmentation is mainly done manually because of the similar gray of the tooth root and the alveolar bone from CBCT images. This study aims to explore the automatic tooth root segmentation algorithm of CBCT axial image sequence based on deep learning.
   METHODS: We proposed a new automatic tooth root segmentation method based on the deep learning U-net with AGs. Since CBCT sequence has a strong correlation between adjacent slices, a Recurrent neural network (RNN) was applied to extract the intra-slice and inter-slice contexts. To develop and test this new method for automatic segmentation of tooth roots using CBCT images, 24 sets of CBCT sequences containing 1160 images and 5 sets of CBCT sequences containing 361 images were used to train and test the network, respectively.
   RESULTS: Applying to the testing dataset, the segmentation accuracy measured by the intersection over union (IOU), dice similarity coefficient (DICE), average precision rate (APR), average recall rate (ARR), and average symmetrical surface distance (ASSD) are 0.914, 0.955, 95.8%, 95.3%, 0.145 mm, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that the new method combining attention U-net with RNN yields the promising results of automatic tooth roots segmentation, which has potential to help improve the segmentation efficiency and accuracy in future clinical practice.

TI  - The Association Between Developmental Defects of Enamel and Early Childhood Caries in American Indian Children: A Retrospective Chart Review
T2  - PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY
AB  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence of developmental defects of enamel (DDE) among American Indian (AI) children and whether DDE are associated with caries experience and rehabilitative treatment under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: This retrospective study reviewed charts of 557 AI children, between 12 and 84 months of age, served by one Indian Health Service clinic in Sisseton, SD, USA. Analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics, including odds ratios (OR). P=0.05 was considered significant. Results: The overall prevalence of DDE was 32.5% (mean equals 0.87 +/- 1.59 per child). The presence of DDE was associated with significantly higher mean decayed, extracted and filled (deft) scores (7.94 +/- 5.06 versus 4.84 +/- 5.14; P<0.001), predicting adverse clinical outcomes. Children with DDE had 3.8, 4.2, and 3.4 times the odds of having caries, early-childhood-caries (ECC), and severe early-childhood-caries (S-ECC), respectively, than those without DDE. DDE were also associated with higher odds of treatment under GA (OR equals 4.4). Conclusions: DDE were prevalent in this cohort of AI children and found to be significantly associated with a higher caries burden and dental rehabilitation under GA. Early recognition of DDE in infants and toddlers along with targeted prevention programs may help reduce the incidence of caries and subsequent treatment under GA.

TI  - Knowledge and Use of Caries Risk Assessment for Adult Patients Croatian Dentists
T2  - ACTA STOMATOLOGICA CROATICA
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usage of caries risk assessment (CRA) by Croatian general practitioners and evaluate their knowledge and attitudes towards CRA. Material and methods: A link to an online questionnaire was sent via e-mail to a sample of 1,500 general dentists in Croatia. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, logistic regression analyses and chi-square tests. Results: Of 257 respondents, 47% performed CRA routinely, but only 4.5% of them used a specific CRA form. The significance of different factors in the development of a treatment plan varied considerably among respondents. Furthermore, in 77% of the respondents CRA was a basis for planning individual caries prevention (ICP). The association between CRA and ICP, and between CRA and treatment planning was statistically significant (p=0.001). The practitioners doing CRA more often plan their treatment and ICP according to CRA. The use of CRA was not influenced by specialty and dentists' experience. Conclusions: In a considerable percentage (53%) of Croatian general dentists, CRA is not part of their routine practice, and there is a strong association between the use of CRA and treatment plans and ICP. There is a need to promote the use of CRA in daily dental practice in Croatia.

TI  - Rehabilitation of a patient with amelogenesis imperfecta using porcelain veneers and CAD/CAM polymer restorations: A clinical report
T2  - QUINTESSENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The complete dental rehabilitation of patients with a vertical dimension loss (VDL) caused by structural enamel deficits associated with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) represents a difficult challenge for restorative teams. Accurate analysis and treatment planning that includes esthetic and functional evaluations and adequate material selection are important prerequisites for successful results. Long-term provisional restorations play an important role in exploring and elucidating the patients' esthetic demands and functional needs. Restorative treatment options can vary from requiring only oral hygiene instructions to extensive dental restorations that include composite fillings, ceramic veneers, metal-ceramic, or all-ceramic crowns. This case report describes a full-mouth rehabilitation of a patient with amelogenesis imperfecta including the case planning, bite replacement, preparation, and restoration setting steps with an experimental CAD/CAM polymer and porcelain veneers.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Digital Image Analysis of Skeletal and Soft Tissue Points A and B after Orthodontic Treatment with Premolar Extraction in Bimaxillary Protrusive Patients
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Malocclusion is a misalignment or inappropriate relationship between the upper and lower dental arches when the jaws close. Orthodontics, such as tooth extraction, clear aligners, or dental braces, are frequently used to address malocclusion, followed by growth modification in children or orthognathic surgery in adults. The treatment goals are to improve facial and dental esthetics, functional occlusion, periodontal health, and stability. It is also feasible to achieve an esthetic improvement of the soft tissue. This study shows how soft tissues change after extraction of premolars in patients with Angle Class I bimaxillary alveolar protrusion through three-dimensional analysis. The results show that changes in soft tissue point A and skeletal point A are three-dimensionally related. Aim. To investigate the effect of changes in incisor tip, apex movement, and inclination on skeletal points A and B and characterize changes in skeletal points A and B to the soft tissue points A and B after incisor retraction in Angle Class I bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion. Methods. Twenty-two patients with Angle Class I bimaxillary dentoalveolar protrusion treated with four first premolar extractions were included in this study. The displacement of skeletal and soft tissue points A and B was measured using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using a three-dimensional coordinate system. The movement of the upper and lower incisors was also measured using CBCT-synthesized lateral cephalograms. Results. Changes in the incisal tip, apex, and inclination after retraction did not significantly affect the position of points A and B in any direction (x, y, z). Linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between skeletal point A and soft tissue point A on the anteroposterior axis (z). Skeletal point A moved forward by 0.07 mm, and soft tissue point A moved forward by 0.38 mm, establishing a ratio of 0.18: 1 (r = 0.554, p < 0.01). Conclusion. The positional complexion of the skeletal points A and B was not directly influenced by changes in the incisor tip, apex, and inclination. Although the results suggest that soft tissue point A follows the anteroposterior position of skeletal point A, its clinical significance is suspected. Thus, hard and soft tissue analysis should be considered in treatment planning.

TI  - Characterizing Motor Control of Mastication With Soft Actor-Critic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The human masticatory system is a complex functional unit characterized by a multitude of skeletal components, muscles, soft tissues, and teeth. Muscle activation dynamics cannot be directly measured on live human subjects due to ethical, safety, and accessibility limitations. Therefore, estimation of muscle activations and their resultant forces is a longstanding and active area of research. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an adaptive learning strategy which is inspired by the behavioral psychology and enables an agent to learn the dynamics of an unknown system via policy-driven explorations. The RL framework is a well-formulated closed-loop system where high capacity neural networks are trained with the feedback mechanism of rewards to learn relatively complex actuation patterns. In this work, we are building on a deep RL algorithm, known as the Soft Actor-Critic, to learn the inverse dynamics of a simulated masticatory system, i.e., learn the activation patterns that drive the jaw to its desired location. The outcome of the proposed training procedure is a parametric neural model which acts as the brain of the biomechanical system. We demonstrate the model's ability to navigate the feasible three-dimensional (3D) envelope of motion with sub-millimeter accuracies. We also introduce a performance analysis platform consisting of a set of quantitative metrics to assess the functionalities of a given simulated masticatory system. This platform assesses the range of motion, metabolic efficiency, the agility of motion, the symmetry of activations, and the accuracy of reaching the desired target positions. We demonstrate how the model learns more metabolically efficient policies by integrating a force regularization term in the RL reward. We also demonstrate the inverse correlation between the metabolic efficiency of the models and their agility and range of motion. The presented masticatory model and the proposed RL training mechanism are valuable tools for the analysis of mastication and other biomechanical systems. We see this framework's potential in facilitating the functional analyses aspects of surgical treatment planning and predicting the rehabilitation performance in post-operative subjects.

TI  - Are multi-detector computed tomography and cone-beam computed tomography exams and software accurate to measure the upper airway? A systematic review
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Background Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has several applications in various fields of dental medicine such as diagnosis and treatment planning. When compared to computed tomography (CT), CBCT's radiation exposure dose is decreased by 3%-20%. However, CBCT produces more scattered signals and may present poorer image quality when compared to medical CT.Objectives To review the findings regarding the accuracy of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and CBCT and to compare the different software programs that segment the upper airway.Search methods Three databases (PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science) were searched for articles and a manual search was performed.Selection criteria The inclusion criteria were defined following the PICO framework: P-any patient with a CBCT or CT; I-dimensional evaluation of the upper airway using MDCT or CBCT; C-phantoms; O-the primary outcome was MDCT and CBCT accuracy, the secondary outcome was the evaluation and comparison of software programs used to segment the upper airway.Data collection and analysis Articles that met eligibility criteria were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Checklist.Results Among the 16 eligible studies, 6 articles referred to the accuracy of MDCTs or CBCTs and 10 to the accuracy of the software. Most articles were qualified as high quality.Conclusions MDCT and CBCT scans' accuracy in upper airway dimensional measurements depends on machine brand, parameters, and segmentation technique. Regarding the segmentation technique, 12 programs were studied. Most either underestimated or overestimated upper airway measurements. In particular, OnDemand3D and INVIVO showed poor accuracy. On the contrary, Invesalius, and MIMICS were accurate in assessing nasal cavities when using an interactive threshold. However, results varied due to methodological differences among the studies. Finally, fully automatic segmentation based on artificial intelligence may represent the future of airway segmentation because it is faster and seems to be accurate. However, further studies are necessary.Registration This study was registered in Prospero (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) with the ID number CRD42022373998.

TI  - Recreating an Esthetically and Functionally Acceptable Dentition: A Multidisciplinary Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERIODONTICS & RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY
AB  - Patients today demand a youthful, attractive smile with comfortable functional acceptance. The complete oral rehabilitation of patients with a functionally compromised dentition frequently involves a multidisciplinary approach and presents a considerable clinical challenge. To a great extent, proper patient selection and careful interdisciplinary treatment planning, including acknowledgment of the patient's perceived needs, reasons for seeking services, financial ability, and socioeconomic profile, can govern the predictability of successful restorations. This clinical report describes a successful interdisciplinary approach for the management of a severely worn dentition with reduced vertical dimension of occlusion. Treatment modalities included periodontal crown lengthening procedures, endodontic treatment followed by post and core restorations, and prosthetic rehabilitation for severe tooth surface loss and reduced vertical dimension of occlusion comprising metal-ceramic restorations in esthetic zones and full-metal restorations in posterior regions.

TI  - Long-term periodontitis treatment costs according to the 2018 classification of periodontal diseases
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: To assess if long-term treatment costs in periodontitis patients differ between stage III vs. IV and grade B vs. C according to the 2018 classification of periodontal diseases.
   Methods: A cohort of 231 periodontitis patients (followed over a mean of 18.4 years) was evaluated. Costs for active periodontal therapy (APT, including scaling and root planning, open flap debridement, root resections) and supportive periodontal therapy (SPT, including also restorative, endodontic, prosthetic and surgical treatment) were estimated from a mixed payer-perspective in Germany (in Euro 2020). Multi-dimensional staging and grading was applied. The impact of stage, grade, sex and age on total and annual costs was assessed.
   Results: Mean (SD) total and annual treatment costs were 7154 (2554) Euro and 437 (222) Euro. Costs were generated during SPT (92 %) and by periodontal treatment (88 %) and decreased significantly with longer follow-up (p < 0.001). Total costs were 7120 (2692) Euro in stage III (n = 154) vs. 7221 (2271) Euro in stage IV (n = 77; p > 0.05), and 6256 (1605) Euro in grade B (n = 35) vs. 7314 (2660) Euro in grade C (n = 196; p < 0.001). Annual costs were 426 (219) Euro vs. 459 (228) Euro for stage III vs. stage IV (p > 0.05) and 308 (163) Euro vs. 460 (224) Euro for grade B vs. grade C (p < 0.001). Multivariable modelling found grade, but not stage, sex and age significantly associated with costs.
   Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, and in patients with severe periodontitis who were systematically treated long-term, grading, but not staging was associated with costs.
   Clinical significance: Treatment costs were higher in patients with more progressive periodontitis and were found to decrease during follow-up. Dentists need to consider costs during treatment planning and communication with patients.

TI  - Bariatric Center Designation and Outcomes Following Repeat Abdominal Surgery in Bariatric Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Repeat abdominal surgery in the bariatric surgery patient population may be challenging for non-bariatric-accredited institutions. The impact of regionalized bariatric care on clinical outcomes for bariatric surgery patients requiring repeat abdominal surgery is currently unknown. This study aims to investigate the association between bariatric center designation and clinical outcomes following hepatobiliary, hernia, and upper and lower gastrointestinal operations among patients with prior bariatric surgery.Methods: This is a cohort study of a large sample of Ontario residents who underwent primary bariatric surgery between 2010 and 2017. A comprehensive list of eligible abdominal opera-tions was captured using administrative data. The primary outcome was 30-d complications. Secondary outcomes included 30-d mortality, readmission, and length of stay.Results: Among the 3301 study patients, 1305 (40%) received their first abdominal reoper-ation following bariatric surgery at a designated bariatric center. Nonbariatric center designation was not associated with significantly higher rates of 30-d complications (5.73% versus 5.72%), mortality (0.80% versus 0.77%), readmissions (1.11% versus 1.85%), or median postoperative length of stay (4 versus 4 d). After grouping the category of reoperations, upper gastrointestinal (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, confidence interval [CI] 0.39-1.11) and abdominal wall hernia surgery (OR 0.52, CI 0.27-0.99) showed a lower adjusted OR for complications among bariatric centers.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that after adjustment for case-mix and patient char-acteristics, bariatric surgery patients undergoing repeat abdominal surgery at nonbariatric centers is not associated with higher proportion of complications or mortality. Complex hernia surgery may be considered the most appropriate for referral.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Performance of the caries diagnosis feature of intraoral scanners and near-infrared imaging technology-A narrative review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS-IMPLANT ESTHETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE DENTISTRY
AB  - PurposeTo describe and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various dental caries diagnostic techniques, including the use of intraoral scanners for caries diagnosis based on near-infrared imaging (NIR) technology.Material and MethodsA MEDLINE search from 1980-2023 focused on dental caries diagnostic techniques, emphasizing intraoral scanners using NIR technology. Alternative caries detection methods were also evaluated for their advantages and limitations, enabling a comparison with NIR. The review included traditional caries tools, the latest detection methods, and NIR's role in intraoral scanners, drawing from case reports and both in vivo and in vitro studies. Keywords like "caries detection," "intraoral scanners," and "Near Infrared Imaging (NIRI)" guided the search. After screening titles and abstracts for relevance, full texts with valuable insights were thoroughly analyzed. The data was grouped into three: traditional diagnostics, advanced digital methods, and intraoral scanner-based detection.ResultsThis comprehensive narrative review described and discussed the current state of dental caries diagnostic methods, given the insufficient number of clinical investigations suitable for a systematic review. Traditional caries diagnosis techniques have shown variable accuracy dependent on a dentist's experience and the potential over-removal of healthy tooth structures. Intraoral scanners have emerged as a novel caries detection method, because of their integration of NIR technology. Various studies have confirmed the efficacy of NIR in detecting interproximal caries and in the early diagnosis of non-cavitated caries. Specifically, intraoral scanners have demonstrated promising results, proving comparable to established diagnostic methods like bitewing radiography. Nevertheless, while the integration of NIR into intraoral scanners seems promising, the technology still faces challenges, notably its accuracy in detecting secondary and subgingival cavities. However, with anticipated integrations of AI, NIR in intraoral scanners could revolutionize early caries detection.ConclusionsIntraoral scanners with NIR technology offer non-destructive imaging, real-time lesion visuals, and enhanced patient communication. Although comparable to bitewing radiography in some studies, a universally accepted diagnostic tool is lacking. Future research should compare them with existing methods, focusing on clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptance.

TI  - Morphological characteristics influencing the orthodontic extraction strategies for Angle's class II division 1 malocclusions
T2  - PROGRESS IN ORTHODONTICS
AB  - Background: Extraction has now been accepted widely in various malocclusions including Angle's class II division 1. However, the levels of scientific evidence in orthodontic treatment planning have been weak, and it is unlikely to systematically provide a rationale and consistent basis in decisions of extraction. This study was retrospectively designed to investigate the initial morphologic characteristics of class II division 1 subjects involving four different extraction strategies, to determine the relevant influential factors when choosing extraction strategies with the most commonly used mechanics and the principle of simplicity in orthodontic treatment based on cases diagnosed and treated by an experienced orthodontist.
   Methods: One hundred and ten samples of Angle's class II division 1 malocclusion with good facial and occlusal outcomes after orthodontic treatment were selected and divided into four groups according to different extraction patterns. For each case, pretreatment models and the lateral radiographs were analyzed. Significant variables of models and craniofacial structures of each group were identified by comparing the measurements using one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) at a significance level of P < 0.05. Then, binary logistic regression analysis was used and a regression equation was established to quantify the correlations among the significant variables and their contributions to the extraction decisions.
   Results: Molar relationship, lower anterior crowding, anterior Bolton index, and anterior overjet measured from models, as well as ANS-Xi-Pm, NBa-PtGn, Li-NsPog', U1-NPog and L1-NPog measured from lateral radiographs were found to be statistically significant. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that lower anterior crowding, molar relationship, and growth pattern were the three most relevant influential factors with a declining impact contributing to the extraction decisions for Angle's class II division 1 malocclusions.
   Conclusions: Angle's class II division 1 malocclusions exhibit various morphological characteristics. Orthodontists should comprehensively consider the reciprocal impact of multiple factors when choosing different extraction strategies for Angle's class II division 1 malocclusions.

TI  - Patient-specific plates for facial fracture surgery: A retrospective case series
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: Surgeons often encounter challenges when treating maxillofacial fractures using conventional methods that involve trimming or bending ready-made titanium plates for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) since it can be time-consuming, imprecise, and inconvenient. This retrospective case series aimed to introduce a novel bone reduction method that utilizes virtual planning, patient-specific surgical guides, and titanium plates. Methods: Seven patients with mandibular symphysis or subcondylar fractures resulting from facial trauma underwent cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) or facial CT scans, and their medical histories were documented. Virtual surgery was conducted based on three-dimensional (3D) stereolithography images derived from CT scans using the FaceGide software (MegaGen, Daegu, Korea). ORIF was performed using patient-specific surgical guides and plates that were designed, printed, and milled. Radiographic, clinical, and occlusal evaluations were conducted at two weeks and six weeks postoperatively. Subsequently, 3D images from virtual surgery and postoperative CT scans were compared. Results: The comparison of 3D virtual surgery and postoperative images revealed minimal surface differences of less than 1 mm. T-scan evaluations indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the two- and six-week postoperative assessments. Favorable clinical outcomes were observed. Conclusion: This novel method demonstrated stable outcomes in terms of occlusion and healing, with no notable complications. Consequently, this approach may serve as a viable alternative to conventional methods. Clinical Significance: Facial fracture surgery that utilizes patient-specific surgical guides and plates within a digital workflow can facilitate meticulous surgical planning, reducing the risk of complications and minimizing operation time.

TI  - Health care savings from microbiological caries risk screening of toddlers: a cost estimation model
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH DENTISTRY
AB  - Objectives: Modeling new biomedical technologies and determining their expected cost is necessary before initiating formal clinical trials. This paper estimates an economic model for the potential cost impact of microbiological screening of toddlers for caries risk compared to the traditional method of managing pediatric caries. Methods: Potential cost savings were calculated based on screening test properties (sensitivity and specificity) derived from a population of 1,180 children aged 1 to 3 years with a caries prevalence of 15 percent. An algorithm was then developed to allocate prevalent and anticipate incident caries, treatment effectiveness assumptions, and existing regional treatment costs. Results: The cost analysis model conservatively predicts savings of 7.3 percent from screening and early intervention. Cumulative dental treatment costs for a child at age 4 years are $367.90 if the child has been screened and $396.70 otherwise. The model further predicts that cost savings increase significantly as caries prevalence increases. Conclusions: Microbiologic risk assessment for pediatric caries may be an example of a preventive public health screening technique that results in both clinical benefits and cost savings. If the model is validated by randomized clinical trials, microbiologic screening could be used by pediatric primary care providers to identify toddlers who require early referral to dentists for further risk assessment and early caries management.

TI  - Benefits of oral urea in patients with hyponatremia and heart failure.
T2  - GALICIA CLINICA
AB  - Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral urea in patients with hyponatremia and heart failure (HF).
   Methods and Results: This is a retrospective observational study of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with HF and hyponatremia (serum Na+ < 135 mEq/L) followed by the Heart Failure Unit between January 2013 and May 2018. The study evaluated sodium normalization levels (Na+ = 135 +/- 3 mEq/ L) after treatment with oral urea. Thirty- four patients were included in the study, and all were on standard treatment for HF. Natremia at the beginning of treatment with oral urea was 126.34 +/- 5.41 mEq/ L, and the mean on the day of normalization was 136.45 +/- 3.22 mEq/ L (p < 0.001). The mean time to achieve sodium normalization was 4.28 +/- 2.37 days. Blood urea at the beginning of treatment with urea was 85.77 +/- 50.51 mg/ dl, and the mean on the day of Na+ normalization was 137.90 +/- 56.66 mg/dl (p < 0.001). There was an increase in diuresis (p < 0.006) and plasma osmolarity (p < 0.001) as well as a slight decrease in serum potassium (p < 0.001). The mean dose of oral urea was 22.5 g/ day. There were no important adverse effects, nor were there significant changes in creatinine levels or the estimated glomerular filtration rate by the MDRD formula.
   Conclusions: When added to the standard treatment for short periods of time, treatment with oral urea is safe and effective at correcting natremia and improving diuresis in patients with hypervolemic HF with hyponatremia.
